            <p>Most SaaS founders waste months guessing at pricing tiers that leave money on the table.
                <u>TierTester</u> is an AI-powered pricing lab that runs the analysis bigger companies pay consultants
                $10K+ to perform. Upload your current pricing, customer data, and competitor info. </p>                
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>The system automatically identifies underpriced features, optimal tier structures, and the exact price points that
                maximize conversion without sacrificing revenue. You get actionable recommendations, not vague advice:
                "Move feature X to your Pro tier and increase pricing by 15% to capture $27K in additional MRR."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The tool simulates different pricing scenarios against your actual customer behavior, showing you precisely
            how changes would impact your bottom line before you commit. For bootstrapped founders reaching $10K-$50K
            MRR, these insights can unlock the path to $1M+ ARR without needing to hire a pricing consultant or data
            scientist.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Start with a simple pricing diagnostic that takes 10 minutes to complete. The system analyzes your current
            structure against benchmarks and shows you exactly where you're leaking revenue. Run unlimited pricing
            experiments,

        <div class="slide">
            <p>...build granular customer segmentation models, and get feature-level value metrics that tell you
            what to charge for and what to bundle. You can even simulate competitive responses to see how your pricing
            holds up against market pressure.

            <p><u>TierTester</u> integrates with Stripe, ChartMogul, and customer survey tools for seamless data
                collection. At $99/month, it pays for itself with a single optimization that captures even 1% more
                revenue. For founders tired of throwing darts at a pricing board, <u>TierTester</u> transforms pricing
                from guesswork into a strategic advantage that compounds with every customer acquisition.</p>

            <i>Overall Rating [8/10]</i>
            Analyzing the value proposition using Alex Hormozi's Value Equation framework.

            <b>🎯 Dream Outcome [9/10]</b>
            For bootstrapped SaaS founders and indie hackers to maximize revenue with minimal changes to their current
            operations by using AI-driven pricing optimization to improve pricing strategies and achieve a potential
            revenue increase of 30-50%.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>🎲 Perceived Likelihood [8/10]</b>
            The solution uses AI, which is increasingly trusted for data-driven decisions, underscored by case studies
            showing founders successfully implementing €400/year tiers that unlocked revenue gains. The alignment with
            growing trends in AI adoption in the SaaS industry further bolsters perceived credibility.

            <b>⏱️ Time Delay [5/10]</b>
            Results could start manifesting within a few weeks to months, as pricing experiments and A/B testing provide
            actionable data to refine strategies and realize gains.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <b>💪 Effort & Sacrifice [6/10]</b>
            Customers need to integrate TierTester with their existing SaaS platforms, trust the AI's recommendations
            over intuition, and potentially adjust pricing tiers based on data-driven insights.

            <b>💡 Improvement Suggestions</b>
            The offer could be enhanced by reducing integration complexity, thus lowering the effort score. Increasing
            transparency of AI recommendations would also improve trust, addressing any perceived 'black box'
            skepticism.

            <p><sub>Category King</sub> This idea has high uniqueness and high value potential, positioning it for
                category leadership.</p>
            <hr>
            The idea scores high on both uniqueness and value. It leverages AI to offer a novel approach to dynamic
            pricing specifically tailored for indie SaaS and micro-SaaS founders—a segment that is currently
            underserved.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            With the potential for boosting revenue by 30-50%, it addresses significant pain points related to
            monetization without requiring changes to customer acquisition strategies. The use of AI-driven A/B testing
            provides a distinct technological advantage. Although there is competition, the specificity in targeting
            indie SaaS distinguishes it from broader market offerings.
