            <p>Most design teams waste countless hours manually hunting for UX problems hiding in plain sight. <b>UX-ray</b> is an AI assistant that automatically scans your interfaces, identifies friction points, and delivers actionable recommendations in minutes instead of days. It's like having a UX expert reviewing your entire product 24/7, flagging poor layouts, conversion blockers, and accessibility issues before they impact users.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            The tool integrates directly with Figma (design tools) and live websites to analyze interfaces against proven best practices. Unlike generic design tools, it provides specific, implementable fixes prioritized by business impact. For stretched-thin design teams drowning in feedback requests and UX debt, this becomes their secret weapon – ship better products faster while maximizing limited resources.
        </div><div class="slide">
            <div>Pricing is straightforward: <br>
                <b>$99/month</b> for startups (up to 25 pages), <br>
                <b>$249/month</b> for growth-stage (up to 100 pages), and <br>
                <b>$499/month</b> for scale-ups with complex products. 
                <hr>
                Start with mid-market SaaS companies with design teams of 2-5 people who are constantly juggling new features against fixing existing UX issues.</div>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p>You grow by targeting design leaders through tool integrations with platforms they already use, partnerships with design communities like <em><img src="https://brandlogos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dribbble-logo_brandlogos.net_if8uk.png" height="40" alt=""></em> and <em><img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/behance-4.svg" height="40" alt=""></em>, and case studies showing 15-30% conversion improvements from implementing the recommendations. Start with a focused scan engine for design systems, then expand into live website auditing, competitive benchmarking, and prioritized improvement roadmaps.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p>This evolves from a detection tool into the essential "design health platform" that connects UX decisions directly to business outcomes. This is where the money and leverage comes in. You could reach <b>$250K MRR</b> with just 500 growth-stage customers at <b>$499/month</b>, making this an attractive acquisition target for larger design tools or analytics platforms looking to add AI-powered capabilities to their stack.</p>

            For teams struggling with design consistency and overwhelmed designers, UX Inspector transforms every designer into a UX expert and every product into a conversion machine – all without adding headcount or expensive consultants.

Overall Rating

/10
Startups and growth-phase companies are missing out on efficient AI-driven UX analysis tools, highlighting a gap in automated insights for accelerated decision-making, a crucial need in today's fast-paced digital landscape.

🚫
Underserved Segments
9
/10
Startups and growth-phase UX teams
Early-stage startups and scaling companies are in dire need of affordable, automated UX analysis tools. Current solutions often cater to larger corporations and come with high costs and complexity, leaving smaller teams to rely on manual, time-consuming processes. This presents a significant opportunity to cater to this demographic with scalable, subscription-based services. [101]

🧩
Feature Gaps
8
/10
Integration with diverse analytics tools
There is a lack of seamless integration options between current UX tools and various analytics platforms. As companies increasingly use diverse analytics stacks, the need for an adaptable, integrative solution is growing. This gap presents an opportunity for tools that offer out-of-the-box integration capabilities with popular analytics platforms, enhancing the utility and reach of the solution. [101]

🌍
Geographic Opportunities
7
/10
Expansion into emerging markets
Emerging markets with rapid digital transformation lack access to sophisticated UX tools. Companies in these regions often have limited resources but high digital growth potential, indicating a strong demand for cost-effective, automated UX solutions. Capitalizing on these markets could provide substantial growth opportunities. [101]

🔗
Integration Opportunities
8
/10
Partnerships with analytics platforms
Forming partnerships with established analytics platforms can offer mutual benefits, including enhanced data-sharing capabilities and expanded tool functionalities. Such collaborations can fill the current gap of disconnected data silos, offering comprehensive, cross-platform solutions to end-users. [101]

💡
Differentiation Opportunities
9
/10
AI-driven actionable insights
Providing highly actionable insights through advanced AI models can differentiate a product in the crowded UX market. Many tools currently offer data but lack the depth of analysis necessary to provide strategic, actionable recommendations tailored to diverse industry needs, making this a valuable opportunity for unique market positioning.
