This app does one thing: it gives overwhelmed teachers immediate access to mental health support without the $150/session therapy bills or six-week waiting lists. <br>
<hr>
</div><div class="slide">
    The platform combines quick 15-minute video sessions with licensed therapists, anonymous peer support groups, and guided stress management specifically designed for classroom situations. Teachers can book same-day sessions during planning periods or after school, with counselors who specialize in educator burnout and workplace toxicity.
</div><div class="slide">
The target market is 3.7 million public school teachers (44% reporting high daily stress and 76% saying their mental health is declining) Teachers already spend their own money on classroom supplies, so paying for mental health support that actually understands their unique challenges is an easy decision. It will help keep them fresh and excited to teach. We need teachers to stay teachers. 
</div><div class="slide">

While the education system continues burning through teachers faster than it can replace them, this app might be the only thing standing between talented educators and complete burnout. The teachers who survive and thrive could be the ones who finally got the support they deserved all along.
