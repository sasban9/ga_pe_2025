Imagine an AI so powerful that it doesn't just retrieve information - it understands, analyzes, and synthesizes it like an expert. <br>
Welcome to DeepSeek, the cutting-edge AI system transforming how we interact with data. <br>

Let's discover what makes DeepSeek special and how it can enhance your work with data!

<h3>What is DeepSeek?</h3>
DeepSeek is an advanced, open-source AI-assistant with an embedded search engine able to write comprehensive reports.
The platform works across various types of tasks, from simple text generation to complex problem-solving, making it versatile for different needs: blog posts, market research, data analysis, and many more.

<h3>Why the Hype?</h3>
The secret behind DeepSeek's hype lies in a game-changing approach that was used by its developers.

The thing is, DeepSeek is able to achieve impressive capabilities while using much less than other AI models.
According to current information, it cost only around $5 million to train the DeepSeek model, while for other assistants, numbers reach tens of millions.

So, here's where one of the DeepSeek's main advantages come from - it is freely available for everyone.
Also, DeepSeek works super fast. In fact, it operates three times quicker than other top AI tools.
So, DeepSeek's accessibility and powerful capabilities make it perfect for anyone, both for personal purposes and business.
Core Capabilities
DeepSeek excels through several key features that make it stand out in the AI landscape.
DeepThink is one of such features, and it lets users observe the AI's step-by-step reasoning as it works through a query.

This helps users identify potential errors in the AI's approach, making it especially useful for refining complex tasks and ensuring more accurate results.
In the below screenshot, you can see an example of DeepSeek's thinking process.

For demonstration purposes, all screenshots are provided in English.

As you can see, DeepSeek approaches queries with a thorough step-by-step process, even the most simple ones like "1+1". Quite impressive, isn't it?

This way, it pursues the goal of giving the best answer possible, which is a very helpful feature.
DeepSeek as a Search Engine
Also, unlike traditional search engines, DeepSeek's "Search" mode can understand the meaning behind your questions.

It interprets vague queries and finds relevant information based on concepts rather than just keywords.
For example, asking "Why do people prefer shopping online?" prompts DeepSeek to analyze content related to online shopping habits, consumer behavior, and digital retail trends.

Then, it will provide you with a detailed report on the question, potentialy even helping you to discover the things you did not expect.
