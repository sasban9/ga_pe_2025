Introduction to Prompting
Welcome to the next stage of mastering DeepSeek!

In this unit, we'll focus on prompt engineering: a skill for crafting prompts - questions or instructions that guide AI responses effectively.


What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompting is about questions or instructions that guide any AI, DeepSeek included, to clear responses.

Why Prompting is Important?
Guidance is crucial because while AI excels in language generation, it lacks real-world experience and common sense.
Therefore, the quality of the DeepSeek outputs will directly depend on what and how you write your query.
In other words, "Recipe ingredients matter."

Like a dish, an AI response suffers if the prompt is built poorly.

Components of an Effective Prompt
A strong prompt includes instructions and details for guidance.

Thus, it will improve AI's interpretation and lead to more accurate results.
Here are two examples that will lead to different response quality:
Vague Prompt: "Write about marketing."
Clear Prompt: "Write a LinkedIn post with marketing tips for small business owners to boost their reach."
The Core Principle of Clear Prompts
The foundation of any good prompt is a clear purpose. When crafting a prompt, it's essential to clarify what you want the AI to do and why.

How to Establish Purpose
Convey purpose by starting with a specific verb and noun, adding context where needed. Here are some examples:
"List common challenges of (niche)"
"Generate a catchy headline"
"Write a LinkedIn post"
"Expand this email"
Adding Intent
Indicating intent in your prompt, like "Generate a headline to increase traffic," aligns AI with your goal.
With these foundations covered, it's time to apply these skills practically.
