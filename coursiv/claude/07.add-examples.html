Why Use Examples?
Examples in prompts are like showing a picture instead of just describing something. They can dramatically improve the AI's understanding of your request by making your expectations more concrete and specific.

Identifying the Purpose of Examples
Let's start with a quick exercise. Fill in the gap to identify why we use examples in prompts.


Repeat task
Great!
Now that you know why examples are useful, let's explore different techniques for incorporating examples into your prompts.
Single Example
A single example is a straightforward technique where you provide the AI with a clear, specific instance of what you're looking for.
Look, you have the following example: "The XYZ Phone combines sleek design with powerful performance. Its edge-to-edge display delivers stunning visuals, while the advanced camera system captures life's moments in breathtaking detail. With all-day battery life and 5G capability, it's the perfect companion for work and play."

Multiple Examples
Using multiple examples is the same process. However, you have to offer a range of acceptable responses or styles. Multiple examples can also showcase different tones, formats, or approaches that the AI can emulate.
You have the following examples:
"The SleekFit Watch redefines modern style with cutting-edge health tracking technology. Its slim, minimalistic design blends seamlessly with any outfit."

"The ProActive Watch brings the ultimate fitness companion to your wrist. Track every step, heartbeat, and sleep pattern with advanced sensors and customizable features."
First, let's identify how these examples differ.

Both examples have the same style but differ in product features

Example 1 targets fitness enthusiasts, while Example 2 targets the general public

Example 1 focuses on style and fashion, while Example 2 emphasizes functionality and fitness

Example 1 uses a technical tone, while Example 2 has a formal, businesslike tone
Correct answer
Example 1 focuses on style and fashion, using a sleek and minimalistic tone, while Example 2 emphasizes functionality and fitness, using an energetic and practical tone. The different tones guide the AI in adopting the appropriate language and focus for each product.

Well Done!
Great job on using examples. You can also use partial examples in exactly same manner by giving a starting point for the AI to complete or expand upon.
While examples are powerful, there are some pitfalls to watch out for:
Which of the following is NOT a good practice when using examples in prompts?
Select all possible answers


Using examples that closely match the specific task or topic at hand

Providing a diverse range of examples to show acceptable variations

Including so many examples that they overshadow the actual request
Incorrect answer
Remember, while examples are useful, providing too many can overwhelm the AI and obscure the main task. Use a balanced number of examples to clearly guide the AI's output.

What to avoid:
Overly specific examples can limit the AI's creativity.
Inconsistent examples confuse the AI about what's desired.
Irrelevant examples might lead the AI off-track.
Too many examples can overwhelm and overcomplicate the prompt.
Select all situations, when examples are particularly valuable in AI prompts?
Select all possible answers


When requesting content in a specific writing style or tone

When working with abstract or subjective concepts

When you need to process large amounts of numerical data

When asking for creative content that follows certain patterns
Incorrect answer
While examples help with style, creative content, and abstract concepts, they offer limited benefit for numerical data processing compared to clear computational instructions.

Among below strategies, select those that help create the most effective examples for AI prompts.
Select all possible answers


Including contextual elements relevant to your specific request

Making examples significantly longer than your desired output

Using highly technical language regardless of your audience

Demonstrating both what to do and what to avoid
Correct answer
Effective examples provide relevant context and demonstrate both positive models to follow and approaches to avoid.

Amazing!
You've mastered the art of using examples in your prompts!

Now, you now know how to craft examples that clarify your intentions, demonstrate desired styles and tones, and guide the AI to produce more accurate and tailored responses.
