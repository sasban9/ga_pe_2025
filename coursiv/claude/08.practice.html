Context Framing
Fill in the gaps to create a well-structured prompt with clear context and task framing.


Repeat task
Excellent work!
You've set a clear context and framed the task perfectly. Now, let's move on to output formatting.
Which of the following prompts best demonstrates effective output formatting?

List some renewable energy sources like the hydroelectric power

What are the pros and cons of renewable energy?

Create a table comparing solar and wind power, include columns for average cost

Tell me about renewable energy like the solar, wind and hydroelectric power
Correct answer
This prompt specifies a clear format (table), defines the exact information needed, and indicates the level of detail required. It also provides context for the intended audience.

How could you optimize this prompt: "Write a product review"?

Refine it by adding context and providing an example

Ask for multiple reviews, allowing flexibility in structure

Simplify it by removing specific details and making it general

Extend the review without changing anything to cover more details
Think about how examples guide the AI in generating a more targeted and accurate response.
Correct answer
Providing an example is an excellent way to refine the prompt. It shows the AI exactly what you're looking for, making the response more relevant and tailored to your needs.

Well done!
Now, let's move to refining a prompt.

Sometimes, the AI's response may need further refinement to meet your expectations.
You've asked the AI to "Explain the basics of blockchain technology," but the response was too technical for your target audience of small business owners.
Which of the following refined prompts is most likely to yield an appropriate response?
Select all possible answers


Describe blockchain technology and its potential relevance to businesses in a way that highlights its key advantages

Explain blockchain technology to small business owners who have limited technical knowledge

Simplify your previous explanation of blockchain, breaking it down into more accessible language

What is blockchain and why should businesses care about it?
Incorrect answer
While this prompt aims to simplify the explanation, it doesn't provide enough specific guidance to ensure the response meets the needs of the target audience. Remember to be explicit about who the explanation is for, how it should be structured, and what kind of language and concepts to use or avoid.
