Elements of an Effective Prompt
An effective prompt is like a well-crafted recipe. It has several key ingredients that work together to produce the best results. You already know "desired outcome" and "context". Let's explore others one by one!

Before we move on to new elements, let's quickly review the basics.

Specifying Desired Outcome and Context
Fill in the gaps to create a basic prompt with a desired outcome and context.

Desired Format
Well done! So, the next is the desired format. This tells the AI exactly how you want the information structured and presented.

Specifying the Desired Format
Fill in the gap to indicate how you want the information presented.


Excellent!
By specifying a clear format, you're making it easy to read and use the information. This can be incredibly helpful when you need to quickly scan or compare the AI's suggestions.

Now, let's add our final ingredient to make our prompt even more powerful.
Additional Constraints or Requirements
Additional constraints or requirements are the ingredients that help you fine-tune the AI's response even further, ensuring you get precisely what you need.

Adding Constraints or Requirements
Fill in the gap to include additional parameters for the AI to consider.


Great job!
These additional constraints help tailor the AI's response to meet specific needs or preferences, making the output even more valuable and targeted.
Now, let's see if you can identify the most effective advanced prompt.
Which of the following prompts is the most effective for getting a detailed, easily-read list of breakfast ideas?

Tell me what to eat before I get angry

List 5 quick and healthy breakfast ideas for busy people

Give me some breakfast recipes

Create a numbered list of 5 healthy breakfast ideas, include the dish name, preparation time, and main ingredients, ensure at least one is vegan
Correct answer
This prompt includes all four elements: a clear desired outcome, specific context, detailed desired format, and multiple additional constraints. It's comprehensive and likely to generate the most useful and easily-read response.

Next, which elements should be included in a well-structured prompt for maximum effectiveness? Now, select all that apply.
Select all possible answers


Vague aspirational goals

Specific format instructions

Additional constraints or limitations

Complex technical jargon
Correct answer
Format instructions and constraints help tailor AI outputs to your specific needs, making responses more useful and focused.

What are effective ways to specify the desired format in a prompt? Select all that apply as well.
Select all possible answers


Asking for specific sections (e.g., name, ingredients, time)

Specifying a table structure

Saying "make it look good"

Requesting a numbered list
Correct answer
Clear format specifications like numbered lists, specific sections, and table structures help organize information for easier consumption.

Congratulations!
You've now mastered the art of constructing advanced prompts. By combining desired outcomes, context, specific formats, and additional constraints, you can get incredibly precise and useful responses from AI.

In our next lesson, we'll explore how to use these advanced prompts in real-world scenarios. Get ready to become an AI communication expert!
