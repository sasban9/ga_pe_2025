Tailoring AI Responses
Today, we're diving into output formatting. Specifying the format of the AI's output is like choosing the right container for your food. It helps organize the information. Ready to make your AI outputs more useful than ever?

The first step is deciding how you want the information structured. Common text structures include paragraphs, bullet points, and numbered lists.
Each format has its advantages. For example, bullet points are ideal for concise information, while paragraphs are better for detailed explanations.

Great!
By specifying the "bullet point" format, you're asking for a concise, easy-to-read summary.
There is an infinite number of formats in which to get your answer!

If you're looking for something more imaginative, you can request responses in the form of a story, dialogue, or even a poem. What else?

Excellent Work!
You can do the same and ask for presentation slides, code programming, and, in general, any format.
Controlling Level of Detail
Sometimes, you need a high-level overview; other times, you need in-depth information. Let's practice specifying the level of detail.

This approach is useful when you have a specific audience that you are targetting, and want AI to help you with it.

For example, imagine you are a biology tutor, and your goal is to explain the concept of photosynthesis to biology newbies. Try it in the following task!

Great job! By specifying different levels of detail, you saw how to ensure the AI's response is neither too simple nor too complex for your needs.
Practice Time
Let's put your output formatting skills to the test! Imagine a travel blog has tasked you to create a detailed comparison of three popular vacation destinations in 2025. The blog wants an easy-to-read format that lets readers quickly compare costs, local attractions, and weather.

Creating a Prompt with All the Elements
Fill in the gaps to create a prompt that clearly specifies the output format, the level of detail, and the necessary structure.


Repeat task
Excellent Work!
You've crafted a prompt that clearly specifies the output format, which will make the AI's response more useful and tailored to your needs.

Remember, the key is to think about how you'll use the information and choose a format that best serves that purpose.

In our next lesson, we'll explore how to refine and adjust your prompts based on the AI's responses. See you then!
