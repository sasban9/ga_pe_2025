Defining Clear Objectives in Prompts
Today, we're focusing on task framing - how to define clearly what you want the AI to do. Let's learn how to craft prompts with crystal-clear objectives!


Action Verb
First, you should have a clear and actionable verb. The action verb tells the AI exactly what type of response you're looking for. Common examples include "analyze," "create," or "summarize."

Choosing the Right Action Verb
Fill in the gap to select the best action verb for the task.


Repeat task
Excellent!
It's important to use active verbs like "Analyze" instead of passive phrases like "analyzed content."

Active verbs give direct instructions and ensure the AI performs exactly what you want it to do with the topic of the impact of social media.
Specific Deliverable
After choosing the action verb, the next important step is defining the specific deliverable. This could be a report, a list, a plan, or any other format you expect.

Defining the Deliverable
Fill in the gap to specify the expected deliverable in the prompt.

Great! Remember that without specifying the deliverable, the AI might give a response that doesn't meet your needs.
Scope or Limitations
Next, it's essential to define the scope or limitations of the task. This gives the AI boundaries and focus, helping it stay on topic. For example, you might ask the AI to focus on a particular time period, region, or aspect of the subject.

Setting the Scope
Now, define the scope or limitations of the task.

Success Criteria
Finally, setting success criteria (if applicable) can help the AI know what makes a good or complete response.

This might include specific metrics or elements the response needs to cover. For example, if you're asking the AI to create a plan, you could specify that it should include pros and cons or potential challenges. Success criteria provide additional clarity and structure.

Establishing Success Criteria
Now, let's summarize the above report by adding success criteria for the task.

Now that we've broken down each element: action verb, specific deliverable, scope or limitations, and success criteria, let's practice crafting a complete, well-framed task.

Well Done!
So far, you're doing a good job!
