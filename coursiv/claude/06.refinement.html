The Importance of Refinement
You might not always get the perfect answer on your first try, and that's okay!

Refining your prompt helps you clarify what you're asking and guide the AI to a better result. It is like tuning an instrument. The better you refine, the more accurate and useful the AI's response will be.


You used the elements of prompt engineering from the previous lessons and created the following prompt:

Repeat task
What is the most significant issue with this AI response?

The response focuses only on the positive aspects of AI

The response includes too many unnecessary details

The response is too broad and lacks specificity

The response is too technical and complicated for a general audience
Correct answer
The response is too broad and general. It doesn't provide specific examples or targeted information, making it difficult to apply to a particular context. Refining the prompt by specifying industries or timeframes would help focus the AI's output.

By adding more details or narrowing down your request, you can get a more focused response. Let's try refining the original prompt!

Awesome!
And you can repeat this process as much as you want, the main thing is to get the desired result!
Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Now that you've learned how to refine your prompts for specificity, let's explore another technique - CoT Prompting. Sometimes, we need to guide the AI's thinking process to get the best results.
We have two cars traveling different distances in different times, and we need to figure out which car has a higher speed. In cases like this, you can use CoT prompting to break down the problem step by step.

Let's identify which car has a higher speed by using CoT prompting.

Great Work!
You've got it! When facing complex tasks, using CoT prompting helps break the problem into manageable steps.
What should you do if you do not know how to decompose a problem into steps for CoT Prompting?

Provide the AI with a single complex question

Avoid using CoT prompting and try a simpler prompt

Ask the AI how to break down the problem into steps

Ask for the solution without breaking it down
Correct answer
Asking the AI to help you break down a problem into steps is a practical approach. The AI can often assist by outlining a step-by-step process, which makes it easier for you to guide the prompt using CoT prompting.
