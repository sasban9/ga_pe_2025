The most important aspect of a prompt is that it should have a clear subject to help the AI accurately generate the desired image.

What Is a Subject?
In the realm of prompts, the subject is the main focus or central element of your description. It defines what your image will be about and sets the stage for DALL-E to work its magic.

By clearly identifying the subject, you ensure that your generated image accurately represents your vision and ideas.
