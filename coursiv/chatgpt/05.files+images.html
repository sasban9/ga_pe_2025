<h2>Understanding ChatGPT Models</h2>
Get ready to discover ChatGPT's file handling capabilities!

In this lesson, we'll explore how to supercharge your AI interactions by uploading and working with different types of files. <br>
From documents to spreadsheets to images, learn how to leverage attachments for more powerful and precise results.

<h3>Using Files as Input</h3>
First, ChatGPT allows you to upload files directly into the chat.

You can use this feature to add context or provide material you want the model to work with.
Supported file types include PDFs, Word documents, text files, spreadsheets (CSV/XLSX), and images.

The only thing you need to do to start working this way is to press the "+" button and choose the needed file.

After uploading a file, you can refer to it in your message as part of the prompt.

For example, "Summarize the attached document," or "Extract key statistics from the uploaded Excel file." After this, ChatGPT will read the content and process it just like a normal input.

<h3>Understanding Documents</h3>
When you upload a document, ChatGPT can extract the text, detect the structure (such as headings or bullet points), and respond to requests like summarization, proofreading, rewriting, or formatting suggestions.
Some practical document-related tasks include:
Summarizing long reports or PDFs
Checking grammar and spelling in essays
Generating content ideas from uploaded drafts
Rewriting or translating based on tone and audience
Working with Spreadsheets
ChatGPT can also read structured data from CSV or Excel files. After uploading, you can ask it to interpret, analyze, compare, or calculate based on the table contents.

Typical spreadsheet tasks include:
Identifying trends in data
Summarizing rows or columns
Cleaning or formatting data
Generating charts based on datasets (when combined with follow-up tools)
Understanding Images
You can also upload images. ChatGPT with multimodal capabilities (like GPT-4o) can interpret visuals including photos, screenshots, scanned notes, diagrams, or charts.

It can extract text from images, describe what it sees, or help analyze the visual structure.

For example, you can upload a handwritten note and ask ChatGPT to turn it into a structured document. You can also share a chart or infographic and ask for an explanation of the key data points.
Prompting with Attachments
It is important to note that when using files or images, your prompts should clearly explain what you want ChatGPT to do. Be direct and provide context if needed.
Some useful prompt patterns include:
"Summarize the key points from the uploaded PDF."
"Convert the scanned image into editable text."
"Check this Word file for grammar and flow."
"Analyze the sales data in the attached spreadsheet."
You can also ask follow-up questions after the initial response.

Since the file remains available in the conversation, you don't need to re-upload or repeat the entire context unless youâ€™re starting a new thread.
Use Case: Proofreading and Rewriting
Upload a draft document and ask ChatGPT to check grammar, clarity, or tone.

You can also ask it to rephrase certain sections or suggest improvements depending on your target audience.
Use Case: Summarizing PDFs and Articles
If you're working with long articles or research papers, upload the file and ask for summaries, highlight extraction, or bullet point versions of the content to save time.

Use Case: Data Insights from Tables
You can upload a spreadsheet and ask questions like:
"What are the top-performing categories?"
"Can you find inconsistencies in this data?"
"What does the revenue trend look like?"
Use Case: Image-Based Extraction
You might upload a photo of a whiteboard, a screenshot of a webpage, or a scanned form.

ChatGPT can help transcribe, format, and even analyze the information shown visually.
When working with a spreadsheet uploaded to ChatGPT, what approach would yield the most insightful analysis?

Asking ChatGPT to create a copy of the spreadsheet

Requesting a complete transcription of all cells in the spreadsheet

Uploading the file without any prompt

Asking specific questions about patterns, trends, or relationships in the data
Correct answer
Specific questions about patterns and relationships help ChatGPT focus on extracting meaningful insights rather than simply repeating the raw data.

What is the most effective way to work with a lengthy PDF document in ChatGPT?

Upload the PDF and ask for a targeted summary of key points or specific sections

Request ChatGPT to read every single page in detail

Upload the PDF without any instructions and see what happens

Ask ChatGPT to count the number of pages in the document
Correct answer
A targeted summary request helps focus ChatGPT on extracting the most valuable information while saving time and generating more useful outputs.

Which of the following are effective strategies when working with image uploads in ChatGPT?
Select all possible answers


Expecting ChatGPT to edit or modify the uploaded image

Requesting extraction of text visible in the image

Asking ChatGPT to describe what it sees in the image

Asking for analysis of charts or graphs shown in the image
Correct answer
ChatGPT can effectively describe image content, extract visible text, and analyze visual data like charts - all valuable ways to work with uploaded images.

Summing Up
All in all, adding attachments makes ChatGPT more flexible and powerful.

Whether you're working with text, tables, or images, combining smart prompts with file input opens up many new possibilities for analysis, editing, and content creation.
