Welcome Back!
Today, we're going to enhance your basic prompt engineering skills to create more complex and effective prompts. We'll explore Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to craft precise prompts that manage complex instructions and optimize AI responses.


Zero-Shot Prompting
Remember when we used to ask ChatGPT directly for a response? This method is called zero-shot prompting. It involves generating responses without providing any prior examples.

This technique is particularly useful when you want ChatGPT to perform a task on which it hasn't been explicitly trained.

Let's Practice!
Imagine you're a support specialist at TechMobile, a company that offers smartphones, mobile plans, and online account services.

Now, think about this: what will you do if TechMobile's customer is having trouble logging into their account?

Few-shot Prompting
Now that we've covered zero-shot prompting and learned how to handle common inquiries, let's move on to few-shot prompting and see how to do it even better.

This technique improves ChatGPT's responses by providing a few examples to demonstrate the expected outcome.

That Was Smooth!
The next technique is chain-of-thought prompting.

This technique helps in improving response accuracy. To apply - break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
What is the primary advantage of using Chain-of-Thought prompting?

It speeds up the response time by skipping details

It makes the prompts less understandable

It simplifies the prompt by removing steps

It breaks down tasks into logical sequences
Correct answer
Breaking down tasks into logical sequences makes it easier for the AI to follow and respond accurately.

Let's apply chain-of-thought prompting. As the name says, this technique will have more than one prompt.

Fill in The Gap!
Consider a complicated customer issue that requires several steps to resolve. How would you guide the chatbot through this process?


Repeat task
Customer's Response:
"I'm experiencing a problem with my H-Pad, which randomly shuts down even though the battery appears charged. This started about a week ago and is now frequent. There are no error messages, but the screen flickers, and the device overheats before shutting down."
Now, after receiving detailed information from the customer, analyze the issue and find out possible solutions or steps for resolution.

It may also determine if the issue needs to be escalated.

Create a prompt that analyzes the issue and generates possible solutions or steps for resolution.


Repeat task
If the issue is resolved at this step, create a third prompt to confirm the resolution and gather feedback.

If an escalation is needed, prepare another prompt to transfer, ensuring all relevant details are passed to the technical support team.

This approach allows the chatbot to systematically handle complex issues, ensuring that no critical details are missed and that the customer's issue is either resolved or properly escalated.
Let's Sum Up!
In this lesson, you explored prompt engineering techniques like few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting and created a customer support chatbot for TechMobile.

Next, we'll dive into context management in prompts. Keep up the great work, and see you in the next lesson!
