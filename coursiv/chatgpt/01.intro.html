            <h3>What is ChatGPT?</h3>
            Hey there, I'm Alex! Today, we're diving into the world of ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM).
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            If you're just starting out using AI, you're in the right place.
            Here, you'll explore what an LLM is and how ChatGPT works.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            I'll even throw in some practical exercises to introduce you to the basics of Prompt Engineering, the most
            important term in the AI world. Ready? Let's get started!
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>What is a Large Language Model?</h3>
            Picture a giant library filled with every book, article, and webpage ever written.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Now, imagine a super-smart librarian who has read everything in that library and can understand and generate
            human-like
            text based on all that knowledge. <u>That's essentially what an LLM is!</u>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            These models are called "large" because they're trained on massive amounts of text data. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            They learn patterns, relationships, and structures in language, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually
            appropriate responses to prompts or questions.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In turn, ChatGPT is like the above-mentioned super-smart librarian, but with a special focus on engaging in
            conversations.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            So, ChatGPT is an LLM developed by OpenAI that is designed to understand and generate human-like text in a
            chat format.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            But How Does ChatGPT Actually Work?
            It's a bit like a game of word prediction.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            When you give ChatGPT a prompt (or ask it a question), it looks at the words you've used and predicts the
            most likely next word based on its training.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            It does this over and over, building up a response word by word.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            For example, if you start a sentence with "The cat sat on the...",
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            ChatGPT might predict "mat" as the next word because it's seen that pattern many times in its training data.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            But it's not just about individual words - ChatGPT understands context and can generate complex, meaningful
            responses.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Suppose you're writing a story and hit a creative block. Try using ChatGPT to help you continue the story.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This is how ChatGPT uses patterns from the data it was trained on and generates responses. Cool, right?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            For another example, try asking the AI about making a snack.

        </div>
        <div class="slide question">

            How do you think ChatGPT responded when you asked for a sandwich recipe?
            <hr>
            <small>1. It generates a random recipe<br>
                2. It copies a recipe from a cookbook<br>
                3. It repeats a recipe it has seen before<br>
                4. It combined its understanding of sandwiches, cooking techniques, and common preferences</small>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            ChatGPT doesn't just repeat a recipe it has seen before or generate a random recipe.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Instead, it combines its understanding to generate a unique response tailored to your question.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Moreover, ChatGPT remembers what you are talking about and can adjust its future responses accordingly.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Try following up on your previous question about sandwiches by clarifying your food preferences.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            As you can see, ChatGPT has the ability to maintain context throughout a conversation.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Yet, without guidance, its answers are not 100% what you need most of the time.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            This is where the importance of Prompt Engineering arises.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            While LLMs are sophisticated pattern recognition systems trained on vast amounts of text data, Prompt
            Engineering is the art of effectively communicating with these language models.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In these terms, Prompt Engineering is all about crafting the right input to get the desired output from an
            LLM like ChatGPT.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Imagine you do not have time to think about ingredients, and you do not want to choose between toasted or
            fresh bread. <b>How would you ask ChatGPT to save you some time?</b>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            So, if you prompt your commands effectively, you can use ChatGPT to achieve your goals successfully, and
            making a sandwich is just a simple example of how LLMs can be helpful.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In fact, there are various applications, from customer service to content creation, where Prompt Engineering
            skills can be utilized to optimize your time and profit with AI.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In this sense, as a beginner Prompt Engineer, your main focus should be on how to effectively communicate
            with ChatGPT to get the best results.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Keep exploring, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun with it!
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The world of LLMs and Prompt Engineering is full of exciting possibilities, and you're just getting started.
