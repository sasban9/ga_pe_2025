What is ChatGPT?
Hey there, I'm Alex! Today, we're diving into the world of ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM).

If you're just starting out using AI, you're in the right place. Here, you'll explore what an LLM is and how ChatGPT works. I'll even throw in some practical exercises to introduce you to the basics of prompt engineering, the most important term in the AI world. Ready? Let's get started!


What is a Large Language Model?
Picture a giant library filled with every book, article, and webpage ever written. Now, imagine a super-smart librarian who has read everything in that library and can understand and generate human-like text based on all that knowledge. That's essentially what an LLM is!

These models are called "large" because they're trained on massive amounts of text data. They learn patterns, relationships, and structures in language, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to prompts or questions.
In turn, ChatGPT is like the above-mentioned super-smart librarian, but with a special focus on engaging in conversations.

So, ChatGPT is an LLM developed by OpenAI that is designed to understand and generate human-like text in a chat format.

But How Does ChatGPT Actually Work?
It's a bit like a game of word prediction. When you give ChatGPT a prompt (or ask it a question), it looks at the words you've used and predicts the most likely next word based on its training. It does this over and over, building up a response word by word.

For example, if you start a sentence with "The cat sat on the...", ChatGPT might predict "mat" as the next word because it's seen that pattern many times in its training data.

But it's not just about individual words - ChatGPT understands context and can generate complex, meaningful responses.

How do you think ChatGPT responded when you asked for a sandwich recipe?

It generates a random recipe

It copies a recipe from a cookbook

It repeats a recipe it has seen before

It combined its understanding of sandwiches, cooking techniques, and common preferences
Correct answer
ChatGPT doesn't just repeat a recipe it has seen before or generate a random recipe. Instead, it combines its understanding to generate a unique response tailored to your question.

Moreover, ChatGPT remembers what you are talking about and can adjust its future responses accordingly.

As you can see, ChatGPT has the ability to maintain context throughout a conversation. Yet, without guidance, its answers are not 100% what you need most of the time.

This is where the importance of prompt engineering arises.

While LLMs are sophisticated pattern recognition systems trained on vast amounts of text data, prompt engineering is the art of effectively communicating with these language models.

In these terms, prompt engineering is all about crafting the right input to get the desired output from an LLM like ChatGPT.

So, if you prompt your commands effectively, you can use ChatGPT to achieve your goals successfully, and making a sandwich is just a simple example of how LLMs can be helpful.

In fact, there are various applications, from customer service to content creation, where prompt engineering skills can be utilized to optimize your time and profit with AI.
In this sense, as a beginner prompt engineer, your main focus should be on how to effectively communicate with ChatGPT to get the best results.

Keep exploring, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun with it! The world of LLMs and prompt engineering is full of exciting possibilities, and you're just getting started. I can't wait to see what you'll create!
