Ethical Considerations
Welcome to the first lesson of Advanced Prompt Techniques! I am Liam, and today, we're diving into the ethical considerations you need to keep in mind when using ChatGPT for prompt engineering.
<hr>

Ethical Considerations
We'll explore issues of compliance, including fair use, copyright, privacy concerns, and other important but slightly yawn-inducing stuff.

But don't worry, I'll try to make it more engaging for you!

Why Do I Need It?
You might wonder, "Why do I need to study this?". I also find such topics a bit too dry for my taste, but here's why you do need to know the legal side of using ChatGPT.

Imagine navigating a maze blindfolded - that's what using AI feels like without understanding the legal implications.

It All Started With…
Once upon a time, a lawyer named, let's say, "Alex" decided to use ChatGPT to help with a legal case. Confident in the AI's abilities, Alex thought this was a foolproof plan. Spoiler alert: it wasn't.
What do you think Alex primarily did wrong?

Alex relied solely on AI without verifying the information

Alex forgot to file the legal documents

Alex did not consult any human experts

Alex used outdated legal precedents
Consider the importance of verification and human oversight.
Correct answer
Alex relied solely on AI without verifying the information. This was a major mistake that led to incorrect arguments in court.

That's Not Funny…
You might find this case amusing, but imagine a surgeon using AI to prepare for operations. Same here. As it happened with Alex, we cannot trust AI 100%.

So What Particularly Happened?
ChatGPT provided fabricated legal precedents, and the case went downhill faster than a sled in winter. Alex had to explain to the court why he presented false information, leading to professional embarrassment and legal repercussions. Yes, this actually happened. Lesson learned: always verify the information your AI provides!

What do you think happened next?

Alex went to prison for using unreliable AI

The judge also used ChatGPT and created even more chaos

The case was dismissed due to fabricated arguments

Alex won the court case and became famous
Think about the risks of relying solely on AI for critical tasks.
Correct answer
The case was dismissed due to fabricated arguments. This shows the importance of understanding and verifying the information provided by AI tools.

Important Lesson
Now, you know why you must first learn the legal side of using any AI tools. Think of it as equipping yourself with a legal shield before heading into battle.

What if you don't? Well, let's just say you might end up like Alex, trying to explain to a judge why your AI made a terrible lawyer.
Compliance in AI Use
Compliance might sound like a buzzkill, but it's your best friend when using AI tools like ChatGPT.

Ensuring compliance means adhering to copyright laws, privacy regulations, and fair use policies. It's like keeping your nose clean in a world where everyone's watching.
What is the main reason for adhering to compliance when using AI tools?

To ensure ethical use of AI

To impress your boss

To maintain professional credibility

To avoid legal troubles
Consider the overall impact of compliance on your work and reputation.
Incorrect answer
Not quite, while your answer is not fully incorrect, the main reason is to avoid legal troubles.

Copyright 101
Let's talk about copyright. Imagine you've created a masterpiece, and someone else claims it as their own. You'd be pretty upset, right? That's what copyright laws are here to prevent. When using AI to generate content, make sure you're not violating someone's hard-earned intellectual property.

How can you ensure you're respecting copyright when using AI tools?

Verify the source of content and get permission, even if it means asking your grandma for her secret cookie recipe

Borrow content and assume no one will notice, just like that time you borrowed your friend's favorite pen and never returned it

Use the content without permission and hope the internet police are on vacation
Think about how you'd feel if someone borrowed your content without asking.
Correct answer
Respecting copyright means verifying the source of the content and obtaining permission, just like you'd want others to do with your work.

Fair Use - Your Legal Loophole
Fair use is like the Swiss army knife of copyright law. It allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for specific purposes like commentary, criticism, and education.

But don't go thinking you can use anything and call it fair use - it has its limits.

Which of the following can be considered fair use?

Using images from the internet without credit

Copying an entire movie for your YouTube channel

Using a short excerpt of a book for a review

Quoting a few lines of a song in an educational video
Fair use is limited and specific.
Incorrect answer
Fair use has limits and typically includes commentary, criticism, and education.

Privacy Concerns - Don't Be Creepy
Privacy is a big deal. Nobody likes their personal data being misused. When using AI, ensure you're respecting privacy laws like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Anonymize personal data and use it responsibly. Remember, with great data comes great responsibility.

How can you ensure privacy compliance when using AI?

Anonymize personal data, follow GDPR regulations, and use data responsibly

Share data freely because who needs privacy when you can have chaos

Throw GDPR regulations to the wind and hope for the best
Privacy compliance covers multiple aspects, just like a well-balanced breakfast.
Correct answer
Ensuring privacy compliance involves anonymizing personal data, following GDPR regulations, and using data responsibly - like crafting the perfect recipe for data protection.

Let's Get Practical
When creating prompts, always verify the source of the information, respect privacy guidelines, and ensure the content falls under fair use. If it sounds like a lot, that's because it is. But hey, nobody said being responsible was easy.

Which of the following actions does NOT align with compliance when using AI tools?

Use only publicly available content

Respect privacy guidelines

Ensure content falls under fair use

Share personal data like it's hot gossip
Think about the one action that would make your compliance officer lose sleep.
Correct answer
Ignoring privacy guidelines and sharing personal data like it's hot gossip does NOT align with compliance. Compliance involves respecting privacy guidelines, ensuring fair use, and using publicly available content.

Wrapping Up
In this lesson, we covered the ethical considerations in prompt engineering, focusing on compliance, fair use, copyright, and privacy concerns. Remember, using AI responsibly isn't just about following rules; it's about maintaining integrity and trust.

On this note, we are finishing the series of lessons on advanced applications of ChatGPT! Quite a journey it was, isn't it?

Not just in this unit, but throughout this guide in general, you took on a lot of different roles and learnt a lot of new skills, congratulations! Now, it's time for the last step - Revise and Recap. See you in the last lesson!
