<h3>Context Management</h3>
In this lesson, we're going to focus on context management in prompts.

We'll cover techniques for preserving context, the self-consistency technique, and strategies for writing clear instructions and providing reference text. <hr>
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to manage multi-turn conversations effectively.
<hr>
Before we start, why do you think it's a big deal to keep the conversation flowing smoothly when chatting with ChatGPT?
<div class="question">
    <li>It helps ChatGPT to asses all the information about you and sell it</li>
    <li>It ensures that ChatGPT can provide relevant and coherent responses over multiple turns</li>
    <li>ChatGPT will create a personalized book about you</li>
    <li>It takes you time, so you make less prompts to ChatGPT</li>
</div>
Think about what makes conversations flow smoothly and stay on topic.
<hr>
Maintaining context ensures that ChatGPT can provide relevant and coherent responses over multiple turns.
<hr>
So, building on that - what do you think are some good tricks for keeping the conversation on track when you're chatting with ChatGPT?
<div class="question">
    <li>Using vague prompts</li>
    <li>Providing unrelated information</li>
    <li>Changing the subject frequently</li>
    <li>Referring back to previous points</li>
</div>

Think about what helps keep a conversation on track.
<hr>
Referring back to previous points ensures that the context is preserved and the conversation remains coherent.

<h3>Start with The Basics</h3>
Let's start with the self-consistency technique. This technique ensures that ChatGPT provides consistent responses across multiple interactions.

By maintaining a coherent and reliable conversation flow, it becomes easier for users to follow and trust the information provided.

This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining a coherent narrative is important, such as email composition.
<hr><b>TASK 1</b>
Fill in The Gap! <br>
Let's see if you can create prompts to maintain self-consistency in a conversation.

<h3>Ask the Model to Adopt a Persona</h3>
In the prompt above, you have already used one strategy for getting better results - you asked the model to adopt a persona, an HR assistant.
<hr><b>TASK 2</b>
Now, to maintain self-consistency when composing the following emails, you have to do that again:

<h3>Provide Examples</h3>
Otherwise, you can ask ChatGPT to write an email by providing an example or another strategy for getting better results.
<hr><b>TASK 3</b>
Type your prompt.

<h3>Using Delimiters</h3>
To clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, you can use delimiters, such as < >, { }, or triple quotes (""). <hr>
Delimiters help ChatGPT understand the structure of your message - whether you're separating instructions from content, defining variables, or quoting a block of text.

<h3>Specifying the Length</h3>
Moreover, you can specify the desired length of the output by adding something like: "Respond in 2 paragraphs," or "Answer in 3 bullet points."

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
In this lesson, we covered context management in prompts, including techniques for preserving context, the self-consistency technique, and strategies for writing clear instructions and providing reference text.
<hr>
Next, we'll dive into Image Generation with the <b>4o model</b>! This will further enhance your ability to leverage ChatGPT. Stay tuned!
