Talking to ChatGPT
In the last lesson of ChatGPT basics, you'll learn how to use the voice chat feature in ChatGPT.

Voice input adds flexibility to your experience, making it easier to interact when typing is not convenient. So, here you'll explore how to enable it, when it's useful, and how to use it effectively.


What is Voice Chat
Voice chat allows you to speak to ChatGPT instead of typing.

It works like a real-time conversation, using speech recognition to interpret your question and then responding with a spoken reply
How to Enable It
To use voice chat, you can use both the mobile app and web version of ChatGPT.

Log into your account and look for the waves-looking icon in the bottom-right corner of your screen. Tap it to start the voice session.

If this is your first time using voice, the tool may ask you to grant microphone permissions. Once that's done, you're ready to speak your prompts instead of typing them.
When Voice Chat is Useful
Voice chat can be especially helpful when you can't or don't want to type.

This includes scenarios like walking, cooking, or commuting. It's also useful for users with accessibility needs or those who prefer to speak rather than write.
You can also use voice chat when brainstorming ideas or exploring topics conversationally. In this sense, the natural back-and-forth format makes it easy to build on your thoughts without pausing to write.
How Responses Are Delivered
When using voice chat, ChatGPT speaks its responses instead of showing them as text by default.

Nonetheless, you will still see a text transcript of both your question and the model's reply in the chat interface.
As you can see on the screenshot below, ChatGPT has provided me with a transcript of its answer to my question that I asked in voice chat.

This dual format is very useful, as it lets you follow the conversation even if you miss part of the spoken response. You can scroll back to review the chat history at any time, just like in text-based mode.
Adapting Your Prompts for Voice
Voice prompts are generally shorter and more spontaneous than typed ones. You don't need perfect grammar or punctuation - ChatGPT can still interpret your meaning. That said, clarity helps.
Speak clearly and at a natural pace. If the model misinterprets something, you can rephrase or follow up with more detail.

You don't need to start over completely - just continue the flow.
Best Practices
Be concise with your prompts, especially when asking for specific outputs. For example, instead of saying, "Tell me everything about history," try, "Give me a short summary of World War I."
If you're using voice for productivity, break tasks into steps. For example:
Ask for ideas
Choose one
Ask to expand or rewrite it
It keeps the conversation focused and easy to manage.
Use Case: Multitasking
If you're busy with another task, such as cooking or organizing your workspace, ChatGPT can take a role of your voice assistant, thus letting you continue interacting hands-free.

You can set reminders, ask for tips, or get step-by-step guidance without switching context.
Use Case: Accessibility
Voice chat is a helpful feature for users with limited mobility, vision challenges, or difficulty typing.

It offers an alternative method of communication that removes barriers to using the tool.
Use Case: Language Practice
If you're learning a language, voice chat can be used to practice pronunciation and conversational flow.

You can speak in your target language and get responses spoken back in that same language.
