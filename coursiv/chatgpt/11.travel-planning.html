        <h3>Travel Planning with AI</h3>
Hi! I'm Liam. Alex told me that you're great at using AI, and I could really use your help!

My travel agent is on vacation, and we need some assistance here at Horizon Havens Agency. Let's see how AI can make your job easier and our clients happier!
<hr>

<h3>Become a Travel Agent with ChatGPT</h3>
As a travel agent, your main goal is to create personalized and engaging travel plans for your clients.
<hr>
For this, you need to come up with a variety of travel package ideas for different types of clients. This includes family vacations, adventure trips, and luxury getaways.

<h3>New Feature</h3>
However, before we start, you need to know about ChatGPT's one more feature - Search with Maps.
To use this feature, you only need to activate the "Search" function and then start inputting the prompts just like you would type a travel planning-related query into Google.
That is, you can just type something like "What are the best restaurants in Paris near the Eiffel tower?", and ChatGPT will provide you with a detailed answer, demonstrating the search results on a map.

Good. Now that you know about the map search with ChatGPT, let's go back to the practice part, where you enter the role of travel agent.

TASK 1
Let's look at how you can use ChatGPT to generate these ideas.


Great job! You've created 5 amazing travel packages. Now I'm thinking of hiring you full-time!

But before we make it official, can you help us a bit more?

A young couple with children has approached us for help planning a family trip. Let's help them out!

TASK 1

Prompting for Personalization
Now that your itinerary is ready, you need to consider personal preferences that clients usually have.
A family wants a customized travel plan for their Disneyland vacation with luxury experiences included. Which prompt would you use to ask ChatGPT for detailed suggestions?

"Provide 3 luxury travel ideas for Disneyland"

"Give me a list of luxury places at Disneyland"

"Write about luxury travel tips"

"Tell me about Disneyland"
Think about the relevance of the client's request.
Correct answer
This prompt is specific and relevant, ensuring that ChatGPT will generate detailed and useful suggestions for activities to travel at Disneyland.


TASK 1
After the ideas are ready, you can ask ChatGPT to include them in your travel plan.


Answering Questions
While we were creating a travel plan, we received a lot of emails. Let's use ChatGPT to address these client queries efficiently. Clients often have questions about destinations and travel logistics, so let's see how AI can help us respond quickly and accurately.

TASK 1
You can paste the client's questions in ChatGPT and add the following prompt to get a draft response for them:

Not only this prompt is a bit irrelevant for the specific Disneyland topic, but it is in general too broad and requests excessive information that would overwhelm both you and the client in any travel planning situation, This is because it does not address specific needs or preferences.
