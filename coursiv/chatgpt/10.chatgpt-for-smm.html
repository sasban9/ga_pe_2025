        <h3>Get Ready to Become an SMM Specialist!</h3>
        As we have seen in the previous lesson, the possibilities of AI are almost limitless. This time, you will work with ChatGPT to create engaging social media posts, develop marketing strategies, and analyze trends!   
        
<h3>Welcome to the Team!</h3>
Alex here again! Today, you've got a task from the owner of EcoGoodwill, a retailer of eco-friendly products. 
They're excited to have you on the team. <hr>
Since it's your first day, I'll help you get started and make sure youâ€™re set up for success.
<hr>
Your goal is to increase engagement and attract new customers using AI tools like ChatGPT. To do this, you'll need to craft effective prompts and use them to create engaging content.
<hr>
To start, you need a variety of post ideas, including tips, customer testimonials, and product highlights.
<hr>
Let's see how you can use ChatGPT to generate these ideas.
<br><b>TASK 1</b>
Create your prompt.
<hr>
Almost done! What should you do after generating post ideas?
<div class="question">
    <small>Ask ChatGPT for specific texts to start your posts with</small><br>
    <small>Ignore the ideas and start over</small><br>
    <small>Post random content without a plan</small><br>
    <small>Take a break and have some coffee</small><br>
</div>

HINT: Think about using ChatGPT to develop your social media content further.
<hr>
After generating post ideas, you should ask ChatGPT for specific texts with which to start your posts. Try it next.
<hr><b>TASK 2</b>
Continue your chat.
<br>
Great! You have great post ideas and text suggestions.
<hr>
Using the same principles of prompt engineering, you can direct ChatGPT to write entire posts by effectively providing all the necessary information. <hr>
New Task! We just remembered that we are planning a series of posts for the upcoming Earth Day! <br>
Suggest a prompt to ask ChatGPT for some useful pieces of advice.
<div class="question">
    <li>"Give me a list of Earth Day facts"</li>
    <li>"Provide 10 tips for Earth Day activities that promote eco-friendly practices for EcoGoodwill, a retailer of eco-friendly products"</li>
    <li>"Suggest some ideas for Earth Day posts that engage followers"</li>
    <li>"Write about Earth Day"</li>
</div>

HINT: Think about specificity and relevance to the event.
<hr>
Providing clear and detailed prompts ensures that the responses are focused and relevant, which is crucial for creating engaging and informative content for events like Earth Day.
<hr>
<h4>A Message from Alex</h4>
Great Job! With these ideas in hand, you can move on to content creation.
<hr>
For this, you will need well-crafted captions for your products.

They also should be engaging and match your brand's voice.
<hr><b>TASK 4</b>
Delegate this task to ChatGPT.
<hr>
After crafting a caption, you need to add a product description to your post. 
How would you craft your prompt to get the most effective response from ChatGPT?
<div class="question">
    <li>"Tell me something about our new eco-friendly items, This is for the post"</li>
    <li>"Describe the new products as much as you can for me to choose the best parts of your answer"</li>
    <li>"We have new products, What can you say about them?"</li>
    <li>"Write a detailed description of our new biodegradable products, highlighting their benefits and eco-friendly features"</li>
</div>
HINT: What did you learn about the importance of details?
<hr>
Right! This prompt will help ChatGPT generate precise and relevant responses, making your posts more informative and appealing.
<hr>
ChatGPT's response to the prompt from the quiz:
<pre>
    "Crafted to reduce environmental impact with materials that decompose naturally, these products minimize waste while delivering high-quality performance. Make the switch today and join us in supporting a sustainable lifestyle!"
</pre>
<hr>
As you can see from this example, prompt engineering can enhance your social media posting and make your job easier.
The next example supports it even more.
<hr>
<br><b>TASK 4</b>
Instagram stories are a great way to engage your audience. Let's script a story featuring a customer's journey with EcoGoodwill:
<hr>
Thank You for Your Hard Work! That is it for now. 
<hr>
Thank you so much for helping EcoGoodwill. 
Your efforts are truly appreciated, and you've made a significant impact on our mission to promote eco-friendly living. 
Your dedication and creativity have not gone unnoticed.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Whether you're brainstorming ideas, crafting captions, scripting stories, or doing an absolutely different type of job, clear and specific prompts can significantly improve the quality of your content.
