<h3>Creating Images with GPT-4o</h3>
In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the image generation feature of 4o model. <hr>
This includes generating visuals through prompts, editing existing images, and understanding how this tool compares to DALL-E. <hr>
You'll also explore best practices and use cases to get the most out of this function.
Let's dive in!
<h3>What Is Image Generation in 4o</h3>
As you could guess, 4o supports native image generation. This means you can describe an image in text and receive a visual output directly inside the ChatGPT interface without needing a separate tool or model.
<hr>
Also, this feature allows for fast, precise, and practical image creation - from infographics and diagrams to photorealistic scenes and comic strips.
<h3>Where to Find It</h3>
To use image generation, you should ensure that you're using 4o model. Next, click on the "+" icon next to the message bar, select Create image and type your prompt into the input box. Then, the model will return an image within seconds.

<h3>Differences from DALL-E</h3>
You probably heard about DALL-E, a model that previously was the OpenAI's standalone image generator. <hr>
However, with the Create Image mode being integrated, it no longer is.
In comparison to DALL-E and, in fact, any other model, this mode integrates image generation directly into its multimodal interface. 
<hr>
In other words, it makes the process much faster and more interactive.
Also, what makes 4o image generation different is the fact that it maintains visual consistency with the textual request better than any other model, including DALL-E. <hr>
Hence, it even allows building complex scenes using its built-in knowledge. <hr>
This feature excels at creating useful imagery - logos, signage, instructions, posters, and more - not just artistic or surreal illustrations. For example, it can render accurate street signs or readable menus with detailed text.
<hr>
Also, it can create images in any style. Check it out by trying yourself in the next couple of exercises!
<hr><b>TASK 1</b>
Let's create a realistic image of real people with ChatGPT.
<hr><b>TASK 2</b>
Now, let's try to imitate the style of a renowned Ghibli studio.
<hr>
As you can see, 4o image generation is very accurate in the results it provides, 
but this is not all of its advantage.<br> It can also:<br>
Understand design layouts<br>
Follow multi-step instructions
<hr>
These strengths allow it to produce functional and communicative images, making it very useful for various applications. Education, design, communication, marketing tasks - these are only some of the spheres where this tool can be used.
<h3>Editing an Existing Image</h3>
Another 4o's advantage over other image generation tools is that you can also modify uploaded images by giving instructions. <br>
This works well for updating designs or adjusting layouts based on feedback.
<hr><b>TASK 3</b>
Let's go back to our rabbit image and change its color.<hr>
Now, before finishing the lesson, let's take a look at the couple potential use cases for he 4o image generator.
<h3>Use Case: Educational and Instructional Design</h3>
Since the tool can generate diagrams, process visuals, or experiment images, it can be used by, for instance, teachers and presenters.
<hr><b>TASK 4</b>
Imagine you're a biology teacher, and you need an illustration of the human respiratory system for the class. Finalize the prompt to see what AI has to offer.

<h3>Use Case: Business and Branding</h3>
Also, you can use GPT-4o to explore logo ideas, design mockups, or generate pitch deck visuals. <hr>
Try it yourself by constructing the prompt in the next exercise.
Complete the prompt to see the result.

Overall, before concluding the lesson, here are some prompt writing tips for you to use:
Make it clear and detailed.<hr>
Mention perspective, colors, or style if important.
Include image use (e.g., "for a presentation" or "for social media").
Keep edits actionable and focused on one or two elements at a time.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Congratulations! You've learned how to use GPT-4o's image generation to create and edit various types of visuals directly within ChatGPT.
<hr>
Whether you need photorealistic images, artistic illustrations, educational diagrams, or business assets, you now have the skills to craft effective prompts that yield impressive results.
