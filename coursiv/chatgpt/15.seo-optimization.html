What If You Don't Have Enough Keywords?
Let's say you are not a professional SEO specialist and cannot get the high Search Volume keywords list. What will you do?

As you asked ChatGPT to optimize the article with keywords, you can similarly ask it to analyze competitors' articles and find additional keywords.

So, if needed, you can further optimize the text by asking ChatGPT to include more keywords from competitors or to suggest relevant keywords you might have missed.
