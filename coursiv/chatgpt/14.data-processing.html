<h3>Complex Prompts for Data Processing</h3>
In this lesson, we're going to delve deeper into creating complex prompts for data processing.

You'll learn how to generate detailed prompts by analyzing a company's revenue and other financial metrics. <hr>
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to craft intricate prompts that guide ChatGPT through multi-step data analysis tasks.
<h3>Welcome to the Team!</h3>
Hi! I'm Sarah, the lead Data Analyst at TechInnovate Corp. Welcome aboard!

Today, you've got your first task as a Data Analyst: analyze the revenue and financial metrics of TechInnovate Corp.
<hr>
To start, you need to understand the company's financial data. Here's a snapshot:
<pre>
Revenue: $5,000,000
Spending: $3,200,000
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $500 per customer
Retention Rate: 80%
Monthly Earnings Growth: 5%
New Customers per Month: 1000
Churn Rate: 5%
Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $100
Operating Margin: 40%
</pre>
<hr>
<b>TASK 1: Let's see how you can use ChatGPT to analyze this data.</b><br>
<hr>
Almost done! What should you do after generating complex analysis prompts?
<div class="question">
    <small>Ask ChatGPT for detailed calculations based on your prompts</small><br>
    <small>Take a break and have some coffee</small><br>
    <small>Ignore the prompts and start over</small><br>
    <small>Start the analysis manually without using ChatGPT</small><br>
</div>
HINT: Think about how to use ChatGPT to develop your data analysis further.
<hr>
Correct! After generating complex analysis prompts, you should ask ChatGPT for detailed calculations based on your prompts. Try it next.
<b>TASK 2: 
Continue your chat.</b><br>
Great! You have the necessary calculations for analyzing complex financial data.

By applying these principles of prompt engineering, you can direct ChatGPT to perform comprehensive data analysis by providing detailed and specific prompts.

ASAP Task! We almost forgot that we need a quarterly financial performance report! Suggest a prompt to ask ChatGPT to create this report.

"Provide a quarterly financial performance report for TechInnovate Corp, including revenue, spending, net profit margin, churn rate, ARPU, and operating margin"

"Write a detailed financial performance report"

"Summarize the complex financial data for the quarter"

"Give me an overview of our financials"
Think about specificity and the inclusion of all relevant financial aspects.
Correct answer
Providing clear and detailed prompts ensures that the responses are focused and comprehensive, which is crucial for creating an effective financial performance report.

A Message from Sarah
Excellent job! With these analyses in hand, you can move on to more advanced data processing tasks.

For this, you will need well-structured prompts to guide ChatGPT through multi-step tasks.

Repeat task
After crafting the financial performance report, what should you include in the analysis to provide deeper insights?

"Include detailed explanations of the financial trends and their long-term implications"

"Leave it as it is"

"Add some general comments about the company"

"List the data without explanations"
What did you learn about the importance of details?
Correct answer
Right! Including detailed explanations of the financial trends and their long-term implications will make the analysis more insightful and valuable.

ChatGPT's Response to the Prompt from the quiz:
"TechInnovate Corp's revenue growth is driven by a consistent increase in new customers and a high retention rate.

The net profit margin of 36% indicates effective cost management.

The monthly earnings growth of 5% suggests a robust and scalable business model.

However, the churn rate of 5% needs to be monitored closely to maintain long-term profitability.

The ARPU of $100, combined with a high retention rate, highlights strong customer value.

The operating margin of 40% reflects efficient operations and cost control."
As you can see from this example, effective prompt engineering can enhance your data processing tasks and make your job easier.

        <b>Let's see how you can use ChatGPT to analyze this data.</b>
        
        <p>You are a senior <u>data analyst</u> for a tech company. Generate <u>five prompts</u> for analyzing complex financial data.</p>
        
<pre>
1. Calculate the net profit margin for the quarter.
2. Determine the impact of the churn rate on monthly earnings.
3. Analyze the relationship between ARPU and retention rate.
4. Forecast the revenue for the next quarter considering current growth trends.
5. Evaluate the operating margin's effect on overall profitability.

<b>Continue your chat.</b>

Now, generate the calculations for the complex financial data analysis . Align these suggestions with the data provided above.
<pre>
"Net profit margin calculation: ($5,000,000 - $3,200,000) / $5,000,000 = 36%"
"Impact of churn rate: A 5% churn rate reduces monthly earnings by $25,000 (5% of $500,000)."
"ARPU and retention rate analysis: With an ARPU of $100 and an 80% retention rate, each retained customer generates $80 monthly."
"Revenue forecast: With a 5% monthly growth and 1000 new customers per month, next quarter's projected revenue is $6,075,625."
"Operating margin effect: A 40% operating margin indicates that $2,000,000 of the revenue contributes to operating income."
</pre>
