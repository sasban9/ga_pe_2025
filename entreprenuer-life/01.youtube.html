            <h2> Let’s dive deep into why YouTube in the mid-2000s became a gold rush and why certain early creators
                skyrocketed while most people stayed invisible.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="slide"
            style="background: url(https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G1OU2mHbQAEKvJG?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) 50% 50%;background-size: cover;">
            <div class="section">In the early days of YouTube (around 2005 - 2008), the platform itself was raw and
                chaotic. </div>
            <div class="section">Most people were uploading casual, unedited clips — home videos, webcam footage, shaky
                cellphone recordings. </div>
            <div class="section">Attention spans were short, and viewers were already overwhelmed by an endless stream
                of low-quality content. </div>
            <div class="section">This created a huge opportunity for anyone who could make <span class="h3">polished,
                    engaging, and easy-to-watch videos.</span></div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 1 -->
        <div class="slide"
            style="background: url(https://www.storyblocks.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/videoeditorskills_thumbnail.jpg);background-size: cover;">
            <!-- <div class="section bg-image" style="background-image: url('https://picsum.photos/seed/11/1200/800');"></div> -->
            <div class="section bg-image">
                The first advantage was <span class="h3">video editing skill.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                Early creators who knew how to trim awkward pauses, add transitions, overlay music, or include captions
                instantly created a smoother viewing experience.
            </div>
            <div class="section bg-image" style="background-image: url();">
                Even small things — like cutting out silence or speeding up certain sections — made videos feel
                professional.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                Editing wasn’t just cosmetic; it influenced <u>viewer retention,</u> which YouTube’s recommendation
                algorithm rewarded.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide"
            style="background: url(https://eldvarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Eldvarm-Stories-How-Stories-Were-Born-Image-2-1024x768.jpg) 50% 50% no-repeat;background-size: contain;">
            <div class="section">The second advantage was <h3>storytelling ability</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="section bg-image" style="background-image: url('https://picsum.photos/seed/2/1200/800');"></div>
            <div class="section bg-image">Even short videos needed a hook, a middle, and a payoff. </div>
            <div class="section">Creators who could build tension, surprise, humor, or emotional resonance kept people
                watching longer. </div>
            <div class="section">They understood that a strong narrative—even in a 2-3 minute clip — was more compelling
                than simply showing something happen.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" style="background: url(https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/636c07c8356eee29c2729d60/9aaad068-2512-41e9-8874-cd41fcfd61d6/audience-capture-psychology-neuroscience-economics-nickocado-beauty-contest.jpg);background-size: cover;">
            <div class="section">The third advantage was <span class="h3">understanding audience psychology.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="section bg-image">Successful early YouTubers grasped what viewers wanted: relatable
                personalities, content they could learn from or laugh at, and a reason to subscribe. </div>
            <div class="section bg-image" style="background-image: url('https://picsum.photos/seed/12/1200/800');">
            </div>
            <div class="section">They anticipated what would trigger shares, comments, or repeat views. </div>
            <div class="section">Many newcomers treated uploading as a passive act — just putting content out — but
                winners treated it as <span class="h3">designing for attention.</span></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="section">Finally, timing mattered. YouTube was growing fast, and competition was still limited.
            </div>
            <div class="section">Early creators who combined editing skill, storytelling, and audience insight could
                rapidly accumulate subscribers,</div>
            <div class="section">...which then compounded through social proof and algorithmic promotion. </div>
            <div class="section">By the time the platform became crowded, the early winners had established <u>loyal
                    audiences and recognizable brands,</u></div>
            <div class="section">...making it nearly impossible for latecomers to replicate their growth without
                significant investment.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="section">In short, success wasn’t just about being “creative.” </div>
            <div class="section">It was about <span class="h3">technical polish, psychological insight, and narrative
                    skill</span> — applied at the perfect moment in an emerging platform. </div>
            <div class="section">Those were the qualities that turned a hobbyist video into a viral sensation and,
                eventually, a career.</div>
        </div>
