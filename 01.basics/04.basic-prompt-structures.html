            Prompts are made up of several key components that work together to guide the AI. While not every prompt
            will contain all these elements, understanding how each part functions can help you create more targeted and
            effective inputs.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The key parts of a prompt are: <hr>
            - The Directive <br>
            - Examples <br>
            - Role (Persona) <br>
            - Output Formatting <br>
            - Additional Information
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>1. The Directive</h3><hr>
            The Directive is the main instruction in the prompt.
            <!-- Schulhoff, S., Ilie, M., Balepur, N., Kahadze, K., Liu, A., Si, C., Li, Y., Gupta, A., Han, H., Schulhoff,  S., & others. (2024). The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques. arXiv Preprint arXiv:2406.06608. -->
            <!-- 2. Searle, J. R. (1969). Speech acts: An essay in the philosophy of language. Cambridge University. -->
            It tells the AI exactly what task it should perform. Without a clear directive, the AI may provide a
            generic or irrelevant response.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is a Directive?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            
            A directive is a concise instruction or question that gives the AI a clear task to perform. It can range
            from a request to generate text, solve a problem, or format information in a specific way.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            For example, here a prompt with a single instruction:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>Tell me five good books to read.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Implicit Directives</h3><hr>
            In some cases, the directive may be implied rather than explicitly stated. These types of prompts still guide the AI but rely on context or formatting to convey the task.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>Night: Noche Morning:</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Best Practices for Directives:</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            - Be clear and concise. <br>
            - Avoid ambiguous or vague instructions. <br>
            - When possible, use action verbs to indicate <br>the specific task (e.g., "write," "list," "translate").
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>2. Examples</h3><hr>
            When the task is more complex, providing Examples can help guide the AI in producing more accurate responses.  <br>
            <figcaption>This technique is especially useful in few-shot and one-shot prompting, where a model is given one or more examples of what you expect in the output.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Use Examples?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Examples demonstrate the expected format, style, or structure of the output. By including them in the prompt, you can guide the AI's behavior and help it better understand the desired result.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>Translate the following sentences: <br>Q: I like apples. A: Me gustan las manzanas.<br>Q: I enjoy walking.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In this example, the AI is shown how to structure the translation, and it will follow the same pattern for
            the remaining sentences.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Best Practices for Examples:</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            - Provide clear and relevant examples that match the task. <br>
            - Use examples to demonstrate the structure or content you expect. <br>
            - Adjust the number of examples based on task complexity (one-shot or few-shot). <br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>3. Role (Persona)</h3><hr>
            Assigning a Role to the AI, also known as a persona, helps frame the response in a specific way. By telling the AI to act as an expert, a professional, or a specific character, you can guide the tone, style, and content of the response.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is a Role?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The role element in a prompt assigns a specific persona or perspective to the AI, encouraging it to tailor its response according to the designated role. 
            <!-- This can greatly enhance the accuracy and relevance of the response, especially for tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge or a particular tone. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Here, the AI is instructed to respond as if it were a medical professional:
            <div class="prompt"><code>You are a doctor. Based on the following symptoms, diagnose the patient: <br>Fever, cough, and fatigue.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The AI will assume the role of a customer service agent, ensuring the tone is appropriate for business
            communication:
            <div class="prompt"><code>You are a customer service agent. Write an email apologizing for a delayed order.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Best Practices for Using Roles: <hr>
            <ul>
                <li>Use roles to add expertise or a specific perspective to the response.</li>
                <li>Ensure the role fits the task at hand (e.g., using a marketing expert to write promotional content).</li>
                <li>Combine the role with additional context for better results.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>4. Output Formatting</h3><hr>
            <!-- Sometimes, it's important to specify the format in which you want the AI to present its output.  -->
            Output Formatting ensures that the response follows a particular structure—whether it's a list, a table, or a paragraph. 
            <!-- Specifying the format can help prevent misunderstandings and reduce the need for additional post-processing. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Output Formatting Matters</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Without clear formatting instructions, the AI may provide a response that is technically correct but not in
            the desired format. <br>Specifying the structure makes the output easier to use.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            It is often desirable for the GenAI to output information in certain formats, for example, CSVs or markdown
            formats. 
            <!-- 3. Xia, C., Xing, C., Du, J., Yang, X., Feng, Y., Xu, R., Yin, W., & Xiong, C. (2024). FOFO: A Benchmark to Evaluate LLMs’ Format-Following Capability. In L.-W. Ku, A. Martins, & V. Srikumar (Eds.), Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 680–699). Association for Computational Linguistics. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2024.acl-long.40 -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            To facilitate this, you can simply add instructions to do so as seen below: 
            <div class="prompt"><code>Case: 2024_ABC_International Client: XYZ Corporation Jurisdiction: EU & USA Filed Date: 2024-09-01 Status:
                Active Lead Attorney: John Doe Next Hearing: 2024-10-15<br>Output this information as a CSV.</code></div>
            <div class="code">
                <code>Case,Client,Jurisdiction,Filed Date,Status,Lead Attorney,Next Hearing<br>2024_ABC_International,XYZ
                    Corporation,EU & USA,2024-09-01,Active,John Doe,2024-10-15</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Style Instructions</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">            
            You can also specify stylistic preferences, such as tone or length, within the output formatting. This
            allows you to control not just the content but how it's presented.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            For example:
            <div class="prompt"><code>Write a clear and curt paragraph about llamas.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>5. Additional Information</h3><hr>
            Additional Information, sometimes referred to as context, though we discourage the use of this term as it is
            overloaded with other meanings in the prompting space[^b]. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            It provides the background details the AI needs to generate a relevant response. <br>
            Including this information ensures that the AI has a comprehensive understanding of the task and the necessary data to complete it.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is Additional Information?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">            
            Additional information can include relevant facts, data, or other background information that helps the AI generate a more accurate and contextually appropriate response. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This element is especially important for complex tasks that require specific knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>
                January 1, 2000: Fractured right arm playing basketball. Treated with a cast.<br>
            February 15, 2010: Diagnosed with hypertension.<br>
            You are a doctor. Predict the patient's future health risks based on this history.
            </code></div>
            <figcaption>In this example, the patient's medical history is crucial to generating a valid prediction.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Best Practices for Additional Information:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Include only relevant information—avoid overloading the prompt with unnecessary details.</li>
                <li>Ensure the information is clearly linked to the task.</li>
                <li>Use this element to provide essential background that the AI might not otherwise have.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>How to Order Parts of the Prompt</h3>
            There is no single "correct" order for arranging the elements of a prompt, but there are guidelines that can
            help improve clarity and prevent misunderstandings. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In general, starting with examples or context and ending
            with the directive ensures the AI focuses on the task after processing the relevant information.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Now that you understand the different parts of a prompt, you may wonder if there is a common order in which you should arrange them. 
            <!-- You should first note that not all of these occur in every prompt, and when they do there is no standard order for them.  -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>However, we do have a suggested order.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            To understand our order, first consider the following two prompts, which each contain a role, an instruction (the directive), and
            additional information.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>You are a doctor. Read this medical history and predict risks for the patient. <br>
                January 1, 2000: Fractured right arm playing basketball. Treated with a cast. February 15, 2010: Diagnosed
                with hypertension. Prescribed lisinopril. September 10, 2015: Developed pneumonia. Treated with antibiotics
                and recovered fully. March 1, 2022: Sustained a concussion in a car accident. Admitted to the hospital and
                monitored for 24 hours.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Another prompt with the same information, but with the instruction at the end:
            <div class="prompt"><code>January 1, 2000: Fractured right arm playing basketball. Treated with a cast. February 15, 2010: Diagnosed with hypertension. Prescribed lisinopril. September 10, 2015: Developed pneumonia. Treated with antibiotics
                and recovered fully. March 1, 2022: Sustained a concussion in a car accident. Admitted to the hospital and
                monitored for 24 hours. <br>
                You are a doctor. Read this medical history and predict risks for the patient.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Although usually both prompts would give approximately the same output, <u>we prefer the second prompt</u>, since
            the instruction is the last part of the prompt.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This is preferable, since with the first prompt, the Large Language Model (LLM) might just start writing more context instead of following the instruction.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            If given the first prompt, the LLM might add a new line:
            <div class="code"><code>March 15, 2022: Follow-up appointment scheduled with neurologist to assess concussion recovery progress.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This is due to the fact that LLMs are trained to predict the next token (similar to word) in a paragraph.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Recommended Order for Prompts:</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <ol>
                <li>Examples (if needed)</li>
                <li>Additional Information</li>
                <li>Role</li>
                <li>Directive</li>
                <li>Output Formatting</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In this prompt, the role and task come after the context, ensuring the AI processes the timeline before
            generating the output.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Order Matters</h4><hr>
            The order of the elements affects <br>how the AI processes the information.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            For instance, placing the directive last helps avoid the AI continuing the additional information instead of focusing on the task at hand.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3><hr>
            Crafting effective prompts requires an understanding of the key elements that guide AI responses.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            By mastering the use of <code>Directives</code>, <code>Examples</code>, Roles, Output Formatting, and <code>Additional Information</code>, you can improve the accuracy and relevance of the outputs generated by AI models. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Experimenting with different combinations of these elements will allow you to tailor prompts for a wide range of tasks and achieve better results.
