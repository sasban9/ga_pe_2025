    <p>ChatGPT is known for its versatility and ease of use, supporting a wide range of tasks from simple queries to complex problem-solving.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    ChatGPT is a great starting point for learning and experimenting with AI models.
    <!-- While there are other AI tools available, we've chosen ChatGPT for its broad capabilities and user-friendly setup, making it a great starting point for learning and experimenting with AI models. -->
  </div>
  <div class="slide">Let's walk through setting up ChatGPT and demonstrate its uses for a variety of tasks, 
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    ...from simple queries to more advanced applications like summarizing articles and solving math problems.

  <div class="slide">
    <h4>Set up ChatGPT</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
<!-- Getting started with ChatGPT is simple: -->

Navigate to <u>https://chat.openai.com</u> <br>
<!-- It will ask you to create an account. <br> -->
Create an account. <br>
Log in with this account.
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    <b>Mobile Setup:</b> You can also download the ChatGPT app from your device's app store. 
    <!-- The interface is similar, and you can log in with the same account. -->

  <div class="slide"><h4>Try Out Some Prompts with ChatGPT</h4></div>
  <div class="slide">
Now that you've set up ChatGPT, let's try out a few prompts for simple and more advanced tasks.
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    <blockquote><img src="https://www.techtarget.com/rms/onlineimages/prompt-h_half_column_mobile.png"  align="right" alt=""> Note: A prompt is the input or instruction given to an AI model to generate a response. </blockquote>
    <!-- Prompts can be simple (a question) or complex (detailed instructions with context, tone, style, and format specifications). The quality of the AI's response depends directly on how clear, detailed, and structured the prompt is. You can read more about prompts in our article about prompt engineering. -->
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
Keep in mind that <b>prompt</b> can be a verb or a noun. 
<!-- You can prompt a model, or you can give a model a prompt. Both mean the same thing, and the process of interacting with the model this way is called prompting. We'll dive deeper into prompt engineering techniques in next lessons. -->

  <div class="slide"><h4>Summarizing an Article</h4></div>
  <div class="slide">    Now, let's try something more practical: summarizing a paragraph. Say you're reading an article about snowfall in Florida and want to quickly grasp the main points.</div>
  <div class="slide">

<!-- You can paste the paragraph into ChatGPT and ask for a summary 1 -->
<figcaption>This paragraph is from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_in_Florida</figcaption>

            <u>Summarize this paragraph in a single sentence:</u> It is very rare for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, especially in the central and southern portions of the state. Except for the far northern areas of the state, most of the major cities in Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, though trace amounts have been recorded, or flurries in the air observed a few times each century. According to the National Weather Service, in the Florida Keys and Key West, there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the European colonization of the region more than 300 years ago. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach there has been only one known report of snow flurries observed in the air in more than 200 years; this occurred in January 1977. In any event, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach have not seen snow flurries before or since this 1977 event.</code></td>

    <h4>Solving Math Problems</h4><hr>ChatGPT can also solve math problems!

  <div class="slide">

<!-- Let's give it a simple arithmetic problem to see how it handles math. -->

<code style="font-family: cursive;">If I have 20 apples, eat three of them, and sell three more, how many do I have left?</code><br>

<div class="code"><code>If you have 20 apples and you eat three of them, you will have 20 - 3 = 17 apples left.

    After eating three apples (17 left), if you sell three more, you will have 17 - 3 = 14 apples left.</code></div>

It's that simple! ChatGPT can handle both basic and more advanced math problems

    <h4>Best Practices for Prompting ChatGPT</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
1. Be specific and clear<br>
2. Structure your prompts<br>
3. Include necessary context<br>
4. Use few-shot examples<br>
5. Iterate and refine
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    
<!-- Here are some helpful tips for writing prompts to get better results from ChatGPT: -->

1. <u>Be specific and clear</u>:
<!-- Provide detailed context and use actionable verbs in your prompts. -->
Instead of vague prompts like "Tell me about grass", try:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="code"><code>Analyze the characteristics of grass in temperate regions, focusing on: <br>
            - Typical color variations by season <br>
            - Average height <br>
            - Common species <br>Format the response as bullet points.</code></div></td>
    </tr>
</table>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
    Tips for clear prompts: <br>

            - Use clear action verbs<br>(analyze, explain, summarize, list) <br>
            - Specify the desired format <br>
            - Include relevant context <br>
            - Define any constraints
