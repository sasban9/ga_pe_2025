        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is Prompt Engineering?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining prompts to improve the performance of generative
            AI models.
            <!-- It involves providing specific inputs to tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, or Gemini, guiding the AI to deliver more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            When an AI model doesn't produce the desired response, prompt engineering is used to iterate and adjust the
            prompt to optimize the output.
            <!-- This method is particularly useful for overcoming limitations of generative models, such as logical errors or insufficient context in responses. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Prompt Engineering is Important?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Generative AI models rely heavily on the input (or "prompt") provided by users.
            <!-- A well-structured prompt is key to leveraging the model's capabilities and ensuring it provides relevant, precise answers. -->

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Prompt engineering is important because:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            o It bridges the gap between vague, general queries <br>and specific, actionable results.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            o It helps mitigate errors, such as generating irrelevant content or <br>incorrect responses.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <li>It ensures that the AI can handle various tasks
                <!-- like creative writing, image generation, or even code development with minimal post-processing needed. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is a Prompt?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            A prompt is the input or instruction given to an AI model to generate a response.
            <hr>
            Prompts can be simple (a question) or complex (detailed instructions with context, tone, style, and format
            specifications).
            <hr>
            The quality of the AI's response depends directly on how clear, detailed, and structured the prompt is.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Here's an example of a simple prompt:
            <div class="prompt"><code>Explain to me what is prompt engineering <br> like I'm 5.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            And here is the response:
            <div class="code"><code
                    class="">Sure! Imagine you have a toy robot that listens to what you say and does things like answering questions or telling stories. But, this robot doesn't always understand exactly what you want unless you say it in a certain way. <br>
                Prompt engineering is like figuring out the best way to talk to the robot so it does exactly what you want. For example, if you want the robot to tell a funny story about a cat, you might need to say, "Tell me a funny story about a cat," instead of just "Tell me a story." <br>
                In short, prompt engineering is about asking the right questions or giving the right instructions to make sure the robot gives you the best answers!</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Applying Prompt Engineering to Improve the Prompt</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Generative AI models, like ChatGPT, can sometimes produce incorrect or misleading outputs.
            <!-- This often happens when a prompt is too vague, lacks necessary details, or doesn't provide clear instructions. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Let's try to refine the prompt and encourage step-by-step <br>reasoning to improve model's output:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <b>Improved Prompt</b><br>
            <div class="prompt"><code>What is 923 * 99? <br>

    Let's go step by step. <br>
    
    Always write out the full number of 0s for each term.</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- What model outputs: <hr> -->

            <b>AI Output</b>
            <div class="code"><code>
    To multiply 923 by 99, we can break it down into smaller steps: <br>

Step 1:<br> Write out the full number of 0s for each term: 923 * 99 = 923 * 990 <br>

Step 2:<br> Multiply the first term by 9: 923 * 9 = 8307 <br>

Step 3:<br> Multiply the first term by 90 (adding one 0): 923 * 90 = 83070 <br>

Step 4:<br> Add the results from step 2 and step 3: 8307 + 83070 = 91377 <br>

Therefore, 923 multiplied by 99 is equal to 91,377.
</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">


            Interestingly, with these additional instructions, ChatGPT provides the correct answer by walking through
            the steps.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This process of editing and refining the prompt is what we call <u>Prompt Engineering</u>.
            <!-- Adding specificity and guidance to the prompt improves the output and guides the model apply logical reasoning more effectively. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Did This Updated Prompt Work?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Generative AI models are trained to predict text based on patterns instead of deep reasoning or factual
            accuracy.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            By prompting the model to explicitly think through its steps and break down the problem, we reduce the
            chance of mistakes and make the task easier for the model to handle.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Examples of Prompt Engineering in Action <br>(Text, Image, and Code)</h4>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="slide">
Prompt engineering is versatile and can be applied to many use cases across text, image, and code generation.
<hr>Here are some examples to illustrate its range:
        </div> -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Text</h3>
            <hr>
            <!-- Let's start with text-based models like ChatGPT. Suppose you need help writing a marketing summary: <br> -->

            <b>Initial Prompt</b>
            <div class="prompt">
                <code>Write a marketing summary for a new AI tool that helps companies automate tasks.</code></div>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The output might be too generic, so you refine it:
            <!-- <h4>Refined Prompt</h4> -->
            <div class="prompt">
                <code>Write a 100-word marketing summary for an AI tool called TaskBot, which automates repetitive tasks for small businesses in industries like retail and healthcare. Highlight efficiency and cost savings.</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="slide">
This provides clearer instructions and results in a more targeted response.

            <h3>Image Generation</h3>
            <hr>
            For models like Midjourney or DALL-E, prompts are crafted to generate specific imagery. <br>

            Writing Tweets
            <hr>
            Next, let's apply prompt engineering in a creative context. Imagine we are developing a fictional AI product
            called "ArchaeologistAI," which tells stories about famous archaeologists.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Let's ask ChatGPT to write a marketing tweet about it.

        <div class="slide">
            This Tweet is inaccurate because ArchaeologistAI doesn't discover new things—it only tells stories. This
            isn't ChatGPT's fault, as it wasn't given enough context.

        <div class="slide">Let's refine the prompt by including more specific details:
