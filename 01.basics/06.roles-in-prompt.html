            <p>In this section, we dive into <u>role prompting</u>, a technique that allows users to assign roles to an AI model to control the style, tone, or depth of its generated text. You'll learn how <u>role prompting</u> is applied to various use cases, including text styling and improving accuracy in tasks like reviews, emails, and math problems.</p>

            <h3>What is <u>Role Prompting</u>?</h3>
            <p><u>Role prompting</u> is a technique that involves assigning a role or persona to an AI model, such as "food critic" or "mathematician," to control the style or accuracy of its responses.</p>

        </div><div class="slide">
            
            <p>By instructing the model to take on a specific role, you can shape how it processes and delivers information. This technique is widely used across many applications, from creative writing to problem-solving.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <h3>Application #1: Styling Text</h3>
            <p><u>Role prompting</u> is most commonly used to alter the style of AI-generated text. By assigning a role, such as a food critic or a marketing expert, the AI can adjust its tone, language, and the depth of its responses based on the given persona.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <h4>Example #1: Changing the Style of a Food Review</h4>
            <p>To ensure your review resonates with your intended audience, consider factors like length, style, language, and tone, and use these to craft a review that speaks directly to your readers' interests and expectations.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            With a thoughtful approach and a focus on quality content, you can create a review that truly captures the essence of the pizza place you're writing about. Let's start with a simple prompt without a role.
        </div><div class="slide">
            <b>Simple Review Prompt:</b>
            Prompt: 
            <code class="prompt">Write a review of [pizza place].</code>
            AI Output: 
            <code> I recently had the pleasure of trying [random pizza place] and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. The pizza was cooked to perfection and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The crust was light and crispy, and the sauce was just the right amount of tangy. The service was also top-notch; the staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend [random pizza place] to anyone looking for a delicious pizza.</code>
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            Let's see how assigning the AI the role of a food critic or a Michelin Guide reviewer changes the output when writing a food review.
            
            <b>Role Prompt - Food Critic:</b>
            
            Prompt:
            <code class="prompt">You are a food critic. Write a review of [pizza place].</code>
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            AI Output
            <code>I recently had the pleasure of dining at [Pizza Place], a cozy pizzeria located in the heart of the city. Despite its small size, the restaurant packs a huge punch when it comes to flavor. <br>
            
                The pizza was cooked to perfection. The crust was delightfully thin and crispy and the toppings were fresh and flavorful. The combination of flavors was simply delicious. The marinara sauce was rich and flavorful and complemented the toppings perfectly. The cheese was gooey and melted in my mouth. <br>
        </div><div class="slide">
                
                The service was also excellent. The staff was friendly and attentive. They were quick to answer questions and made sure that our food was served on time. <br>
                
                Overall, my experience at [Pizza Place] was fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious pizza.</code>
            
            We can see that it adds more detail and goes a bit more in-depth. Now let's go a step further and make it assume the role of a writer for the Michelin guide:
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            <h3>Role Prompt - Michelin Guide Reviewer:</h3>
            Prompt
            <code class="prompt">You are a food critic writing for the Michelin Guide. Write a review of [pizza place].</code>

        </div><div class="slide">
            <h3>Example #2: Writing Email</h3>
            <p>Let's consider another example of styling text with <u>role prompting</u>. Let's say you ask the AI to write an email to a client to inform them about a delay in the delivery schedule due to logistical issues.
        </div><div class="slide">
                 
            Your goal is to effectively convey this update while ensuring the client's confidence in your services remains unwavering.</p> <br>
            
            <p>When drafting emails, <u>role prompting</u> can significantly change the tone of the message depending on the role assigned to the AI.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            <h3>Communications Specialist:</h3>
            For instance, one possible role is that of a communications specialist, whose style might be clear, professional, and to the point: <br>
            
            Prompt
            <code class="prompt">You are a communications specialist. Draft an email to your client advising them about a delay in the delivery schedule due to logistical problems.</code>

        </div><div class="slide">
            
            <h3>Marketing Expert:</h3>
            Alternatively, have the model adopt the role of a marketing expert to lean more on persuasion, positivity, and relationship building:
            
            Prompt:
            <code class="prompt">You are a marketing expert. Draft an email to a client advising them about a delay in the delivery schedule due to logistical problems.</code>

            AI Output
            <code>The answer is 1400.</code>
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            <p>This is a correct answer, but if the AI had simply been prompted with <code>What is 100*100/400*56?</code>, it would have answered 280 (incorrect).</p>
