        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In this section, we cover our first prompting technique, <u>Instruction Prompting</u>. It consists in providing
            clear instructions or directives to the AI model.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">We have already seen simple instructions used in the doc about prompt engineering like
            getting an AI to solve the math problem. However, we can instruct Gen AIs to do much more complex tasks.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What is Instruction Prompting?</h4>
            <!-- 1.Efrat, A., & Levy, O. (2020). The Turking Test: Can Language Models Understand Instructions? -->
            <!-- 2.Mishra, S., Khashabi, D., Baral, C., Choi, Y., & Hajishirzi, H. (2022). Reframing Instructional Prompts to GPTkâ€™s Language. Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2022. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.findings-acl.50 -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Instruction Prompting </b> centers around the ability of Generative AI models, particularly large language models
            (LLMs), to follow natural language instructions.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Instruction Prompting aims to allow models to work with new, previously unseen tasks by understanding and executing instructions expressed in natural language, without requiring task-specific training data.
        </div>
        <div class="slide"> For example, instead of training a model on multiple examples of extracting the fourth word
            from a sentence, you can simply instruct it: "Write the fourth word of the sentence."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Why Instruction Prompting is Important</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Generative AI models rely on well-crafted instructions to understand tasks and deliver accurate results.
            <!-- Instruction Prompting enables users to guide AI through complex tasksâ€”like text formatting, PII removal, and essay evaluationâ€”without needing vast labeled datasets or pre-programmed rules. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">This method is flexible and scalable, making it particularly useful for adapting AI to new tasks. 
            <!-- It also helps mitigate the risks of incorrect outputs by enabling prompt iterations and adjustments. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Examples of Instruction Prompting</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Name Parsing <hr>
            One common task in data processing is formatting names correctly, especially when users input names in
            different orders (e.g., "John Smith" or "Smith John"). Instruction Prompting allows you to automate this
            task effortlessly.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>A user has input their first and last name into a form. We don't know in which order their first name and last name are, but we need it to be in this format '[Last name], [First name]'.<br>Please convert the following name in the expected format: John Smith</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- <div class="code"><code>Smith, John</code></div> -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">Try changing the name until you find one that the prompt does not properly handle. If you can
            do this, perhaps you will be able to improve to prompt as well! This is a fun exercise to improve your
            Prompt Engineering skills.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Organizations often need to redact personal information from documents. 
            <!-- With Instruction Prompting, Generative AI can automatically identify and replace PII, saving time and reducing manual effort  -->
            <!-- 3 Allowing AI to remove PII from text is a promising approach, but it should be used with extraordinary caution as it may make mistakes. -->
            <!-- 4 It should also be noted in this example that you are sending PII to a third party (e.g. OpenAI if you are using ChatGPT), and these services may record and use your prompts for their own needs. -->
        </div>
        
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt"><code>Read the following sales email. Remove any personally identifiable information (PII), and replace it with
                the appropriate placeholder. For example, replace the name "John Doe" with "[NAME]".
            <br>Hi John,
            <br>I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a
                local dealership (Cheap Dealz), and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If
                you're interested, please let me know.
            <br>Thanks,
            <br>Jimmy Smith
            <br>Phone: 410-805-2345 Email: jimmysmith@cheapdealz.com</code></div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">AI Response:
            <!-- 5 We used a different GenAI, GPT-3, for this example. -->
            <div class="code">
                <code>Hi [NAME],<br>
                    I'm writing to you because I noticed you recently purchased a new car. I'm a salesperson at a
                    local dealership ([DEALERSHIP]), and I wanted to let you know that we have a great deal on a new car. If
                    you're interested, please let me know. <br>
                    Thanks, <br>
                    [SALESPERSON] <br>
                    Phone: [PHONE NUMBER] Email: [EMAIL ADDRESS]</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">It is very exciting to see how the model can extrapolate from the instructions. For example,
            it knows to replace <u>Cheap Dealz</u> with <code>[DEALERSHIP]</code> and <u>Jimmy Smith</u> with <code>[SALESPERSON]</code>, even though we did not
            explicitly tell it to do so.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Essay Evaluation and Feedback</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Instruction Prompting can also be used to evaluate essays based on various criteria like grammar, coherence,
            and argument quality. The model can provide detailed feedback and scores, simulating the task of a human
            reviewer.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="prompt">
                <code>Read the following excerpt from an essay and provide feedback based on the following criteria: grammar,
                    clarity, coherence, argument quality, and use of evidence. Provide a score from 1-10 for each attribute,
                    along with reasoning for your score.<br>
                    "Despite the popular belief, there's no solid evidence supporting the idea that video games
                    lead to violent behavior. Research on the topic is often contradictory and inconclusive. Some studies found
                    a correlation, but correlation doesn't imply causation. So, it's premature to blame video games for violence
                    in society."</code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">The AI's response:
            <div class="code">
                <code>Attribute: Grammar Score: 9 Reasoning: The essay is mostly grammatically correct, but there is a minor error
                    - 'correlation doesn't imply causation' should be 'correlation doesn't imply causation'.
                <br>Attribute: Clarity Score: 8 Reasoning: The essay is generally clear, but could provide more
                    detail or explanation about the contradictory and inconclusive nature of the research.
                <br>Attribute: Coherence Score: 8 Reasoning: The arguments are coherent and related, but the
                    transition between them could be smoother.
                <br>Attribute: Argument Quality Score: 7 Reasoning: The argument presented is logical and
                    well-reasoned, but it could be strengthened with a clearer statement of the writer's position on the issue.</code>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Instruction Prompting is a powerful technique that allows Generative AI models to handle complex tasks by providing clear, concise directions.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Through examples like name parsing, PII removal, and essay evaluation, we can see how flexible and scalable this method is.
