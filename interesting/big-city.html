Slide 1: Title
Big City Behavior Isn’t a Kolkata Problem — It’s a Global Pattern
What I learned after leaving my hometown

Slide 2: The Initial Frustration
I used to feel hurt when people from smaller towns said:

“Kolkata people are selfish.”
“They talk behind your back.”
It felt like an unfair judgment.

Slide 3: A Broader Exposure
But then I lived in other cities.
Big ones. Fast ones. Global ones.
And I noticed something surprising.

Slide 4: Same Behavior, Different City
Mumbai: Transactional and fast-paced

Bangalore: Friendly but cliquish

Delhi: Warm but often political

New York: Blunt and brutally self-focused

London: Polite but emotionally distant

It wasn’t a Kolkata thing. It was a big city thing.

Slide 5: Why Cities Shape People This Way
In big cities:

Everyone is in survival mode

Time is scarce

Competition is high

Relationships are layered and strategic
Result? People seem cold, distant, or even two-faced.

Slide 6: Contrast With Small Towns
Small towns feel more:

Close-knit

Personal

Emotionally honest
Because reputations matter more. And people know each other.

Slide 7: Realization Hit Me
I stopped blaming cities or defending them.
It wasn’t about geography or culture.
It was context.
People behave differently based on environment.

Slide 8: The Empathy Shift
Now I see things differently:

I take fewer things personally

I ask where someone’s coming from

I try to carry both:

small-town warmth + big-city resilience

Slide 9: What I Know Now
No city is “bad.”
No people are inherently selfish.
We’re all just adapting to our surroundings—doing our best to survive and connect.

Slide 10: Closing Thought
If you’ve ever felt judged for your city or judged others for theirs—pause.
Look deeper.
Behavior is shaped by pressure, not always by intent.
And empathy is always in style—no matter the pin code.
