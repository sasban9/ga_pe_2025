            <h3>Make it Skimmable!</h3>
            You're already doing something very smart by making screencasts of your GitHub projects — that's exactly the
            kind of signal that makes a busy hiring manager take notice. <br>
            To push your value even further and make your offerings irresistible to employers, here's a multi-pronged
            strategy:

            Absolutely — let’s unpack this carefully. AI models are already moving beyond general-purpose chatbots into **highly specialized tools**, and the evolution is likely to accelerate in the next few years. Here’s how I see it unfolding:

</div><div class="slide active">

<h3>1. Vertical Specialization</h3>

<p>Instead of one giant “jack-of-all-trades” model, companies will build <u>domain-specific models</u> optimized for certain fields. For example:<br></p><br>

<div>* <b>Legal AI:</b> trained on case law, contracts, statutes, and legal reasoning, capable of drafting, summarizing, and even analyzing risks.<br></div>
</div><div class="slide">
<div>* <b>Medical AI:</b> trained on clinical studies, patient data (anonymized), and guidelines to assist diagnosis, treatment plans, and research.<br></div>
<div>* <b>Financial AI:</b> specialized in market analysis, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance.</div>

</div><div class="slide">

<p>The advantage is that these models can have <u><b>deeper reasoning in one area</b></u> than a generalist model could, because their training data is curated to maximize domain expertise.</p>

</div><div class="slide">

<h3>2. Real-Time & Connected Knowledge</h3>

Future models will combine:<br>
<table><tr>

    <td>* <b>Pretrained expertise</b> (like ChatGPT today)</td>
    <td>* <b>Real-time information access</b> (like Perplexity or Grok)</td>
    <td>* <b>Specialized data streams</b> for specific industries</td>
</tr></table>
</div><div class="slide">

<b>Example:</b> a legal AI could pull <u>real-time court decisions, new regulations, and filings,</u> giving lawyers insights faster than manual research. <br>
Financial AI could track market data, social sentiment, and news to generate actionable analysis on-the-fly.

</div><div class="slide">

### 3. **Multimodal Integration**

Models will increasingly handle **text, images, video, audio, code, and structured data** simultaneously. Specialized models might:

* Analyze X-ray images alongside patient records (medical AI)
* Read architectural drawings and building codes together (construction AI)
* Combine news, social media, and stock charts (finance AI)

This allows deep context in a way single-modality models can’t achieve.

</div><div class="slide">

### 4. **Tool-Enhanced and Hybrid Models**

Specialized models will integrate **external tools** natively:

* Calculators, databases, spreadsheets, APIs
* Simulation engines or modeling software
* Automated document filing systems

Example: a tax AI that can **read your accounts, check laws, calculate obligations, and generate a ready-to-file report**.

</div><div class="slide">

### 5. **Explainability & Compliance**

As AI becomes specialized, explainability will matter more:

* Legal AI must **cite statutes**.
* Medical AI must **show evidence behind diagnoses**.
* Financial AI must **provide audit trails for recommendations**.

Specialization will push models to **not just produce answers, but justify them** rigorously.

</div><div class="slide">

### 6. **Human-in-the-Loop Customization**

Even specialized models will have a **collaborative layer**:

* Professionals can **teach the model preferences or style** (like tone in contracts, risk tolerance in finance).
* Models will adapt to **organizational knowledge** (internal policies, past decisions) for maximum usefulness.

</div><div class="slide">

### 7. **Smaller, More Efficient Deployments**

Not all applications need a 100-billion-parameter general model. Field-specific models will likely be **smaller, faster, and cheaper** while outperforming generalist models in their domain.

</div><div class="slide">

<p><b>In short:</b> The future will likely look like a <u>network of specialized AI experts</u> rather than one giant omniscient model.<br><br> You might have: a Medical AI for diagnostics, a Legal AI for contracts, a Finance AI for trading, all communicating and collaborating with each other — and with you — to solve real-world problems faster than humans ever could alone.</p>

<!-- If you want, I can **map a full timeline of AI specialization** showing likely fields, capabilities, and when they’ll become mainstream. This could be a 5–10 year horizon. It gives a crystal-clear picture of the future. Do you want me to do that? -->
