Most CRMs force healthcare admins and construction managers to hack together solutions that barely meet compliance requirements. TemplateCRM delivers pre-built, compliance-ready CRM setups that understand exactly what each industry needs. The platform ships with healthcare-specific HIPAA workflows, construction project management templates, and other niche configurations that would take months to build internally. At $149-499/month depending on team size, you're solving the "$50K implementation nightmare" problem for mid-market companies that can't afford enterprise solutions but need more than generic CRMs.
</div><div class="slide">
Start with two underserved verticals where compliance matters most: healthcare administration and construction management. Each template includes industry-standard fields, automation rules, regulatory checklists, and reporting dashboards built specifically for that sector's workflows. You're not selling software, you're selling peace of mind and weeks of implementation time saved.
</div><div class="slide">

The go-to-market is direct and targeted: industry trade shows, vertical-specific podcasts, and partnerships with consultants who already serve these niches. You can reach $10M ARR by capturing just a small fraction of businesses frustrated with generic CRMs that require expensive customization. As you grow, add new verticals like legal, education, and nonprofit, each with its own compliance requirements and specialized workflows.
</div><div class="slide">

Decision-makers instantly see the value because they've lived the pain of forcing standard CRMs to meet their unique industry needs. Your templates transform months of custom development into a same-day solution.
