            Selling used stuff is a massive time sink. Taking photos, researching prices, posting on multiple platforms,
            managing inquiries - it's exhausting. Home Sale Helper automates the entire process. Take a photo, and
            instantly get optimal pricing, auto-generated listings, and cross-platform posting to Marketplace, eBay,
            Poshmark, and OfferUp. The app handles buyer questions, negotiation guidance, and tracks everything in one
            dashboard.

            At $9.99/month or 5% of sales, you tap into the $80B resale market without the usual headaches. The target
            is homeowners decluttering, parents with outgrown kids' items, and everyday people with too much stuff and
            too little time. Growth comes through Facebook selling groups, decluttering influencers, and real estate
            partnerships.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Start with a simple phone app that uses computer vision to identify items, suggest prices based on completed
            sales data, and auto-generate listings with one tap. Add integrations to post across platforms
            simultaneously, then layer in negotiation assistance and automated responses.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Most users waste 2-3 hours per sale - Home Sale Helper cuts that by 50% while boosting conversions through
            optimized listings. The platform evolves from listing assistance to a complete resale operating system,
            turning your unused items into effortless income.
