Most health-conscious business travelers abandon their fitness routines when faced with disappointing hotel gyms and jet lag. FitCompanion is the all-in-one smart travel fitness system that combines ultralight equipment with an AI coach that adapts workouts to your space, schedule, and energy level. 
</div><div class="slide">
    The hardware fits in a carry-on (resistance bands, smart sensors, collapsible gear) while the app delivers personalized 20-minute workouts for hotel rooms, creates jet lag recovery plans, and tracks your fitness consistency across time zones.
</div><div class="slide">
At $249 for the kit and $19/month for the companion app, you're targeting the $1 trillion wellness tourism market with a focus on 6-figure professionals who travel 10+ times annually. These people already spend $3-5K yearly on wellness subscriptions, premium gyms, and health tech - but lose all consistency when traveling.
</div><div class="slide">
The wedge is frequent business travelers who feel the pain most acutely. You grow by partnering with business travel platforms, hotel chains seeking wellness amenities, and corporate wellness programs looking for differentiated benefits. Start with direct outreach to business travel communities on LinkedIn, Reddit, and Facebook groups for road warriors.
</div><div class="slide">
For the MVP, focus on the software first - build an AI workout generator that uses basic hotel room items, then add the custom gear package as you validate demand. You aim for $1M ARR within 18 months by capturing just 3,500 paying subscribers.
</div><div class="slide">
Long-term, this evolves beyond fitness into the ultimate wellness travel companion - adding sleep optimization, nutrition guidance for airports and room service, and even cognitive performance tracking. The platform becomes the operating system for maintaining health on the road, creating a $10M+ business that would make an attractive acquisition for Whoop, Oura, or even business travel platforms looking to add wellness components to their stack.

<h3>Why Now?</h3>
The global wellness tourism market, currently valued at over $1 trillion, is projected to reach up to $2 trillion by 2034 with a growth rate of 9.3%. This booming market creates an opportune moment to launch FitKit, a tech-integrated portable wellness solution for travelers, addressing the fitness disruption faced by 58% of American travelers.

</div><div class="slide">
<h3>Proof & Signals</h3>
FitKit's Smart Wellness Travel Gear addresses a significant demand in the travel and fitness market, with strong community engagement and positive sentiment across digital platforms. Proof signals demonstrate growing interest and need among travelers for portable fitness solutions that integrate technology for maintained routines on the road.

</div><div class="slide">
<h3>The Market Gap</h3>
The biggest market gap for FitKit is the lack of smart, integrated wellness solutions for business travelers and frequent flyers, who represent a significant segment of travelers facing disrupted routines. This underserved market is crying out for portable, tech-enabled solutions that can seamlessly integrate into their travel lives, offering a huge opportunity for differentiation.

</div><div class="slide">
<h3>Execution Plan</h3>
Launch a smart fitness solution for travelers with an MVP: a smart resistance band paired with a tracking app. Leverage Instagram and YouTube for quick wins in user engagement, then establish hotel partnerships in APAC for geographic expansion. Ready to redefine travel fitness on a global scale?
