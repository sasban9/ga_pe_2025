            You bought a rental property thinking it would be passive income, but now you're a part-time accountant,
            maintenance coordinator, and therapist for tenants who think a clogged toilet constitutes an emergency at 11
            PM.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Your "investment" has turned into a second job managing spreadsheets that make your CPA weep, tracking
            expenses in three different apps, and trying to remember if that $47 receipt from Home Depot was for the
            upstairs toilet or downstairs sink.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This accounting software actually understands landlords instead of treating you like a generic small
            business owner. It is designed for you! It automatically categorizes your property expenses, tracks rent
            payments without you chasing people down, and generates tax reports that don't require a CPA to understand.
            Nice clean reports during tax time. No sweat.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            At $29-99/month based on how many units you manage, it pays for itself the first time you avoid a late fee
            because you forgot to track a payment, or when your accountant doesn't charge you extra for deciphering your
            "system" of sticky notes and random Excel files.
            The beautiful part is once landlords get their properties, tenants, and financial chaos organized in one
            place, they'd rather sell their rental than switch to another platform. Sticky Recurring Revenue. We love
            it.

            This turns wannabe real estate moguls into actual investors who know their numbers and get their weekends
            back instead of playing property management detective every Saturday morning.
