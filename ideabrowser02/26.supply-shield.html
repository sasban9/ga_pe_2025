Most small retailers and restaurants waste 20-30% of inventory through spoilage, overstocking, or emergency restocking at premium prices. StockSense is an AI assistant that predicts exactly what you'll need before you run out. It integrates with your POS system, analyzes sales patterns, and sends real-time alerts when items are trending toward stockout or overstocking. You get a simple dashboard showing what's moving, what's stalling, and exactly when to reorder - no more guesswork or midnight supplier runs. At $99-$249/month, it pays for itself within weeks through waste reduction alone.
</div><div class="slide">
The wedge is independent restaurants and boutique retailers who feel inventory pain most acutely but can't afford enterprise solutions. You start by solving one critical pain: predicting optimal reorder points for perishables. Then expand into automated purchase orders, supplier price comparisons, and seasonal demand forecasting. You grow through restaurant supplier partnerships, POS system integrations, and targeting owner Facebook groups with case studies showing "30% less waste in 30 days."
</div><div class="slide">

Start with a simple dashboard connected to their POS data that highlights three things: what's about to run out, what's not moving, and what to order now. Use AI to analyze historical sales patterns against external factors like weather, local events, and seasonality. As trust builds, this becomes the operational backbone for small retail - the layer between sales and purchasing that optimizes cash flow and reduces the anxiety of inventory management.
</div><div class="slide">

For market entry, target 50 restaurants at $149/month, validating $7.5K MRR. Expand to 200+ locations within 18 months by partnering with POS providers and small business consultants. Long-term, StockSense becomes the intelligence layer for small retail operations, unlocking additional revenue streams through supplier marketplaces, financing options for inventory purchases, and white-label versions for retail franchises. At 2,000 locations paying $199/month, this becomes a $5M ARR business with sticky retention and natural expansion paths into adjacent operational challenges.
