            Most SEO professionals waste hours sifting through expired domains manually, missing hidden gems that could
            dramatically boost their search rankings. DomainHunter uses specialized AI to automatically scan, evaluate,
            and rank expired domains based on their backlink quality, domain history, and niche relevance‚Äîall metrics
            that directly translate to SEO value.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            You get a dashboard that shows exactly which domains are worth bidding on, complete with authority scores,
            estimated traffic value, and industry-specific relevance ratings. For SEO agencies and digital marketers
            drowning in domain research, this cuts discovery time from days to minutes and turns domain acquisition into
            a competitive advantage.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            At $99-299/month based on search volume and filter needs, you're targeting the professionals already
            spending thousands on SEO tools but missing this critical piece. The market is perfect: SEO experts
            understand domain value, have budget, and feel constant pressure to find edges their competitors don't have.
            You start by serving boutique SEO agencies and growth marketers who need quick wins for clients, then expand
            to in-house SEO teams at mid-market companies.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The tech stack is straightforward but powerful: combine backlink API data (Ahrefs, Majestic, Moz) with
            custom NLP for niche detection and ML models trained on successful domain flips. Your AI doesn't just check
            basic metrics‚Äîit understands which link patterns actually translate to ranking power. The real innovation is
            how you contextualize domain value within specific industries rather than generic "domain authority" scores
            that everyone else uses.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Growth comes through SEO communities on Twitter, Reddit, and Slack groups where practitioners already
            discuss domain strategies. Create comparison case studies showing how domains found through your platform
            outperform randomly selected alternatives. Partner with auction sites to become the intelligence layer for
            their domain marketplace.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Eventually, you evolve into a full domain portfolio management system that tracks performance, suggests
            optimal link building, and helps customers maximize ROI across their entire domain strategy.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            At 500 power users paying an average of $199/month, you hit $1.2M ARR with relatively low customer
            acquisition costs. The exit opportunity is clear: acquisition by SEO platforms like Semrush or Ahrefs that
            want to close gaps in their suite, or by domain registrars looking to add premium services. You're not just
            selling domain data‚Äîyou're selling an algorithmic advantage in one of digital marketing's most competitive
            and profitable niches.
