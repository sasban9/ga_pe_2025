Small business valuations are expensive, complicated, and usually controlled by brokers with conflicting interests. ValuationGenie gives first-time buyers and entrepreneurs instant, accurate business appraisals without the $5,000+ price tag. Upload financial statements, answer a few questions about the business, and get comprehensive valuation reports with comparable sales data, industry benchmarks, and negotiation leverage points. At $99/month, you get professional-grade insights that previously required hiring specialized firms or relying on biased broker estimates.
</div><div class="slide">
The platform analyzes financial data, market conditions, and industry-specific metrics to generate valuations that stand up to scrutiny. For sellers, it helps set realistic asking prices and highlight value drivers. For buyers, it identifies red flags and negotiation opportunities that might save thousands. You can start with a basic valuation and upgrade to expert review services, due diligence checklists, and deal structuring templates as you move forward.
</div><div class="slide">
ValuationGenie grows through partnerships with small business marketplaces, accounting software integrations, and business brokers looking to serve smaller clients profitably. The typical customer journey starts with a one-time valuation ($99) and evolves into subscription access ($99/month) during active acquisition searches. By democratizing business appraisal technology, ValuationGenie transforms an opaque, relationship-driven process into a transparent tool that gives DIY investors bargaining power previously reserved for deep-pocketed buyers.
