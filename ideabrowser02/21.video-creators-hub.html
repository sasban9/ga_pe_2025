            <h4>Trend Analysis</h4>
            The AI video market is witnessing explosive growth, with a significant talent gap and no existing comprehensive job-matching platform for AI video creators, suggesting strong upward momentum.
            
            </div>
        <div class="slide">
Most ad agencies are drowning in AI video requests but don't have the specialized talent to deliver. Video Creator Hub is the first dedicated marketplace connecting agencies and studios with certified AI video specialists who understand both creative direction and prompt engineering. 
</div><div class="slide">
Agencies post projects or hire full-time talent, while verified AI creators showcase portfolios of generated work and command premium rates. You charge $299/month for recruiter memberships, take 15% of freelance contracts, and offer $999 candidate spotlight packages that guarantee interviews.
</div><div class="slide">
The talent gap is massive - agencies need to deliver AI video at scale but their traditional teams lack the technical skills. Meanwhile, thousands of new AI video specialists are emerging without clear career paths. This creates the perfect marketplace opportunity: high-value talent with specialized skills meeting businesses with urgent delivery needs. The wedge is mid-sized agencies ($2-20M revenue) facing client pressure to deliver more video for less budget. You grow through agency partnerships, AI video courses, and creator communities already teaching these tools.
</div><div class="slide">
Start with a simple two-sided platform using no-code tools like Webflow, Memberstack, and Airtable. Focus on quality over quantity - manually verify the first 100 creators to establish the marketplace's premium positioning. Expand from job listings into skills verification, team training, and eventually a full talent operations platform. At 500 paying agencies and 5,000 active creators, this becomes a $5-10M ARR business with strong defensibility as the industry standard for AI video talent.
</div><div class="slide">
The real opportunity isn't just a job board - it's becoming the infrastructure layer for an entirely new creative workforce. As demand scales, you can launch creator certification programs, AI video production standards, and talent development pipelines that turn it into the central hub for this emerging $42B industry transformation.
