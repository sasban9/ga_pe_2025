            You're 52, making decent money, and absolutely miserable at work. Your kids think you're ancient, your boss is 12 years younger and calls everything "disruptive," and you just realized you have 15 more years of this soul-crushing routine ahead of you. AI is flying toward you at light speed.. you want to evolve. Meanwhile, every career coach wants to treat you like a recent college grad who needs to "find their passion" while you're juggling a mortgage, college tuition, and parents who keep falling down.
        </div><div class="slide">
            Midlife Fancy is where accomplished professionals in career crisis finally find their people. Think country club meets support group meets exclusive networking event, but for people who remember when MTV played music and understand that pivoting at 50 means you can't just "follow your dreams" - you need a actual plan that doesn't destroy your family's financial security.
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            The magic happens when 50-year-olds realize they're not alone in feeling like their careers peaked in 2012 and everything since has been an expensive midlife crisis disguised as professional development. These people don't need motivation. They need strategy, connections, and tools to prep them for the next wave. 
        </div><div class="slide">
            
            At $197/month for membership, it's cheaper than therapy but more effective than career coaching because the advice comes from peers who actually understand your constraints. While younger professionals are still figuring out what they want to be when they grow up, Midlife Fancy members already know who they are - they just need help becoming who they want to be next.
