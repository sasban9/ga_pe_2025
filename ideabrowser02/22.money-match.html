Most couples fight about money because traditional budget apps weren't built for shared finances. MoneyMatch solves this by creating true transparency without sacrificing privacy. The app gives you both a real-time shared dashboard of expenses, savings goals, and spending habits while maintaining personal discretionary zones that respect individual autonomy. 
</div><div class="slide">
    Instead of accusatory "what did you spend on?" conversations, you get automated category tracking, joint goal visualization, and smart alerts when spending patterns shift. At $9.99/month, you're investing in relationship peace.
</div><div class="slide">
The market is massive and underserved. While personal finance apps focus on individuals, 70% of couples report money tension as their primary relationship stress point. MoneyMatch captures this $6.6B growth opportunity by starting with young couples handling merged finances for the first time. 
</div><div class="slide">
    You expand through relationship counselors, wedding planners, and financial advisors who become natural distribution channels. The app evolves from basic budget tracking to a full relationship financial platform with investment tracking, debt paydown strategies, and major purchase planning tools.
</div><div class="slide">

MoneyMatch transforms money conversations from potential arguments into productive planning sessions where both partners feel equally informed, empowered, and respected. When financial transparency meets personal autonomy, couples can finally build wealth together without the drama.
