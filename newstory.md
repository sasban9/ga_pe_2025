### 🔟 **Thou Shalt Be Kind to Thy Promptee**

**Kindness and clarity go hand in hand. How you speak to the one you're prompting affects the quality of the response.**

Whether you're talking to a person, an AI, or even prompting yourself for journaling or creative thinking, kindness creates clarity, engagement, and better results. Here's what that looks like in practice:

---

#### 💬 **Use Polite Language**

A simple *“please,”* *“thank you,”* or *“can you…”* sets the tone. AI may not "feel," but polite phrasing often leads to more helpful, human-like results. It also builds habits that translate well into human interactions.

> ❌ “Do this now.”
> ✅ “Could you please write a summary of this article?”

---

#### 🧠 **Respect Cognitive Limits**

Don’t overload your prompt with a wall of text and twenty tasks. Break it down and be considerate of how information is processed.

> ❌ “Explain this book, compare it to two others, summarize it in five styles, and write a poem.”
> ✅ “First, give me a brief summary of this book. Then I’ll ask for comparisons.”

---

#### 🤝 **Give the Benefit of the Doubt**

If the result isn't what you hoped for, don't blame the system. Instead, revise the prompt. Clear prompting is a shared responsibility.

> ❌ “You didn’t get it.”
> ✅ “That’s close, but let me clarify what I meant…”

---

#### 🪞 **Be Kind to Yourself Too**

When you're the one crafting prompts, self-compassion matters. If your first draft isn't great, that’s normal. Prompting is a skill — treat yourself like someone who’s learning, not failing.

> ✅ “I’m still refining this idea. Let me try again with a clearer structure.”

---

#### 🗣️ **In Human Collaboration**

Prompting isn’t just for AI. If you’re leading a team or guiding a conversation, framing requests with clarity, respect, and kindness creates trust, openness, and better ideas.

> “I’d love your insight on this. Could you help me brainstorm some alternatives?”

---

### ✨ In Short:

> **Clarity + Respect = Better Responses**

Being kind isn’t about being soft — it’s about being intentional, respectful, and aware that behind every prompt, there's a processor — biological or digital — working hard to understand you.
