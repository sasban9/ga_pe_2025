            Alright, let's fully expand <h4>Module 6: The Future of Capital</h4> in the same detailed, lecture-friendly,
            reflective style as Module 1.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Module 6: <h3>The Future of Capital</h3>

            <h4>Learning Goal</h4>
            To explore how capital itself is being reshaped in the AI era, who controls it, and what new models of
            ownership, wealth, and power may emerge.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Lecture Narrative</h4>
            For most of history, capital was tangible — land, gold, factories, machines. In the digital age, it became
            intangible — code, platforms, algorithms, networks.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In the age of AI, it becomes something even more abstract: **data, models, and compute power**.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This shift matters because whoever owns the capital defines the future of labor. If a few corporations own
            the most powerful AI models, they hold the ultimate leverage
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            over productivity, information, and markets. AI capital doesn't just multiply labor — it can replace it.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            But capital in this new age is not just centralized. It is also <u>fragmenting into new forms:</u>
            cryptocurrencies, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), tokenized assets, shared equity models, and
            open-source AI.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>The future of capital could become either <u>hyper-concentrated in trillion-dollar giants</u> or
                <u>distributed
                    across millions of small stakeholders.</u> Which path society takes will shape inequality for
                decades.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Key Concepts to Explore

            <h4>1. Who Owns AI Capital Today?</h4>
            - Corporations: OpenAI (Microsoft-backed), Google DeepMind, Anthropic, etc.<br>
            - Governments: National AI labs, defense-funded projects.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            - Individuals/communities: Open-source AI projects like Hugging Face, Stability AI.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>2. Centralized Capital vs Decentralized Capital</h4>
            <p>- <u>Centralized</u>: Power and profit flow upward, small number of actors dominate.<br>
                - <u>Decentralized</u>: Distributed ownership, collective decision-making, cooperative models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>3. Trillion-Dollar Capital Structures</h4>
            - The rise of mega-cap tech companies that treat AI models as infrastructure.<br>
            - AI capital compounds at unprecedented speed: more data → better AI
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            better AI → more users → more data.<br>
            - Winner-takes-most dynamics.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>4. Redistribution Mechanisms</h4>
            <p>- <u>Universal Basic Income (UBI):</u> Capital profits redistributed as a safety net.<br>
                - <u>Data dividends:</u> People paid for the data that trains AI.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>- <u>AI taxes:</u> Governments taxing automation-driven profits to fund society.<br>
                - <u>Equity for laborers:</u> Workers as shareholders in companies, not just wage-earners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- ### **Case Studies**   -->

            Case 1: <h4>Google and Search</h4>
            Google's search algorithms turned user data into compounding capital. Billions of searches daily improved
            Google's AI while users received only convenience, not ownership.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Case 2: <h4>Bitcoin and Ethereum</h4>
            Cryptocurrencies introduced a radically different form of capital: decentralized, borderless, programmable.
            Labor became mining or staking, and capital became accessible to anyone with hardware and internet.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Case 3: <h4>OpenAI vs Hugging Face</h4>
            OpenAI (capital-heavy, closed, corporate-backed) vs Hugging Face (open, community-driven). A glimpse into
            two futures of AI capital: centralized fortress vs distributed commons.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>
            If AI capital compounds far faster than human labor, is it ethical for a handful of companies to own most of
            it? Or should AI be treated as a kind of “public utility” like roads, electricity, and water?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Exercise
            <h4>1. Imagine you are tasked with designing a <u>new capital model for AI.</u></h4>
            - Who owns it (corporations, governments, citizens, DAOs)?<bR>
            - How do profits flow?<bR>
            - How is access ensured for fairness?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. Compare your model with today's system.<br>
            3. Debate: which one is more sustainable in 50 years?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>
            “Will the future of capital be <u>techno-feudalism</u> (a few AI lords and billions of digital serfs), or will
            we create <u>digital cooperatives</u> where everyone shares in the wealth?”
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Closing Thought</h4>
            In the age of AI, labor risks being automated away. But capital itself is being reinvented. The real battle
            is not just labor vs capital — it is <h4>who owns the capital of the future.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            If ownership stays concentrated, inequality explodes. If ownership is distributed, AI could become the
            greatest equalizer in history.
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="slide">
            Would you like me to also **add role-playing scenarios** here, like “students simulate being a government, a
            corporation, and a workers' union negotiating AI wealth distribution”? That could make the module come alive
            in workshops.
