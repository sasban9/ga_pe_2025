            Great choice — **Module 4: AI as the Great Disruptor** is where the course starts hitting hard. Let me
            expand it into a full lecture-style module with depth, historical parallels, exercises, and reflection
            prompts.

            Module 4: <h3>AI as the Great Disruptor</h3>

            <h4>Learning Goal</h4>

            To explore how AI fundamentally alters the balance between capital and labor, shifting power structures,
            wealth creation, and the very meaning of work.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Lecture Narrative</h4>

            For centuries, machines replaced muscle. The plough, the spinning wheel, the steam engine — each one
            mechanized what human or animal bodies once did. Labor shifted from physical strength to coordination,
            intelligence, and creativity.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            But AI doesn't just replace muscle;<u>it replaces mind.</u> A lawyer's assistant, a doctor's diagnostician, a
            programmer's code, an artist's sketch — AI can now perform tasks once thought uniquely human.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            This creates a profound question: if labor's last fortress was “thinking,” and AI can also think (or at
            least simulate thought), where does that leave human workers?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Capital's answer has been swift: those who own AI systems — data, models, and platforms — see compounding
            returns at an unprecedented scale.
        </div><div class="slide"> 
            Unlike traditional machines, AI improves itself, scales globally in an
            instant, and costs nearly nothing once trained.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Labor's challenge is sharper: many jobs are not just automated but <u>obliterated.</u> Entire professions may
            shrink or transform beyond recognition. Yet, AI can also be a collaborator — amplifying what one human can
            do, creating “super-labor” that is more productive than ever.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            So the struggle re-emerges: will AI cement capital's dominance, or can labor find new ground?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Key Concepts to Explore

            <h4>1. AI as Exponential Capital</h4>

            * A single AI system can replace thousands of workers at near-zero marginal cost.<br>
            * Unlike traditional machines, AI can continuously learn and improve, making capital “alive.”<br>
        </div><div class="slide">
            * Platforms (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, Microsoft, etc.) hold gatekeeper power.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>2. The Fragility of Labor</h4><h3> in the AI Age</h3>
            * Routine white-collar jobs at risk (legal clerks, accountants, copywriters, coders).<br>
            * Even creative fields disrupted (music, design, video production).<br>
            * Gig workers replaced not just by other humans, but by algorithms.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>3. “Labor Without Laborers”</h4>
            * AI can create output (texts, images, software, decisions) without human input.<br>
            * Question: if machines generate wealth, who gets paid? Owners of capital, or displaced workers?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>4. AI as a Labor Amplifier</h4>
            * Doctors using AI diagnoses improve survival rates.<br>
            * A single creator using AI can run an entire media empire.<br>
        </div><div class="slide">
            * Workers who adopt AI become 10x more productive — but do they capture that surplus, or does capital
            capture it?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>5. Data as the New Labor</h4>
            * Every user generates training data. Is this unpaid labor?<br>
            * Platforms extract value from billions of human interactions without wages.<br>
            * Ownership of data determines who benefits.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- ### **Case Studies** -->

            <h4>Case 1: The Lawyer's Paradox</h4>
            A law firm adopts AI to draft contracts. Productivity doubles. The firm doesn't hire new lawyers — it hires
            fewer. Capital (the firm's owners) benefit, while junior lawyers face fewer opportunities.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Case 2: The Gig Worker vs the Algorithm</h4>
            A translator in India once earned modest wages. AI translation systems now outperform him at scale.
            Platforms still charge clients, but the worker is cut out. Capital absorbs labor's value.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Case 3: The Solo Creator Empire</h4>
            A YouTuber uses AI to script, voice, animate, and edit videos, producing daily content at studio scale.
            Labor becomes amplified — one person equals a team of 50. </div><div class="slide">
            But note: success still depends on owning capital
            assets like distribution channels, audience trust, and monetization rights.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>
            If AI could perform 90% of your current work better and faster, what is the remaining 10% that makes you
            valuable? Is that enough to build a livelihood on, or does it need to be reimagined as a new kind of labor?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Exercise</h4>
            1. Pick a profession (teacher, doctor, artist, software engineer).<br>
            2. Break down the tasks that profession performs.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. Mark which tasks AI can already do, which tasks AI will likely do in 5 - 10 years, and which tasks AI may
            never do.<br>
            4. Discuss: where does that leave the human professional? Is their labor amplified, displaced, or redefined?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>

            “Is AI the end of labor as we know it, or the birth of labor as capital?”
            In other words: can workers learn to treat their skills, data, and outputs as assets that compound, rather
            than hours that perish?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Foreshadowing Future Modules</h4>

            This sets up Module 5 (“New Forms of Labor”), which explores how humans might reinvent work in an AI economy
            — through gig systems, creator platforms, or AI-assisted entrepreneurship.

            Would you like me to **weave in real-world current events** (like strikes by Hollywood writers, AI replacing
            call center jobs, or companies like Nvidia and OpenAI concentrating power) into these modules, so students
            see the live unfolding of theory in practice?
