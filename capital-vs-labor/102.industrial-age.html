            Module 2 :— <h3>The Industrial Revolution and the Labor-Capital Divide </h3><h4>(Career Lens)</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- ### **Opening Hook** -->

            Close your eyes for a moment and imagine this: You've trained for years, mastered a craft, and built your
            livelihood around it. One day, a new machine arrives. Suddenly, the work you spent a lifetime perfecting can
            be done faster, cheaper, and with fewer mistakes.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Would you be angry? Scared? Hopeless?

            This is not science fiction. This is exactly what millions of workers felt during the Industrial Revolution.
            And it's exactly what many of you fear now, in the AI age.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 1: <h3>What the Industrial Revolution Did to Labor</h3>

            Before machines, most people's lives revolved around <u>craftsmanship.</u> </div>
            <div class="slide">
            If you were a weaver, a blacksmith,
            or a farmer, your skill defined your career. It was respected, even if it was hard.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Then came machines. Steam engines, power looms, factories. Suddenly, <u>machines multiplied output,</u> and one
            factory owner with a handful of machines could produce what hundreds of skilled workers once made.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Workers rioted. You may have heard of the **Luddites** — skilled artisans who destroyed machines in anger,
            because those machines had stolen their livelihoods. 
        </div><div class="slide">
            They weren't anti-progress. They were scared of being made irrelevant.<br>

            Doesn't that sound familiar? Many professionals today are looking at AI with the same fear.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 2: <h3>The Great Divide</h3>

            Here's the brutal truth: The Industrial Revolution did not benefit everyone equally.

            <h4>Owners of machines (Capital)</h4> — They became extraordinarily wealthy.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Factories grew, profits multiplied, fortunes were made.
            <h4>Users of machines (Labor)</h4> — They often became cogs in the machine. Repetitive, monotonous, and
            replaceable.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            The divide widened. A small group controlled capital (machines, factories, networks), while the majority
            sold labor cheaply.

            <h4>Career Lesson for You:</h4><p>In the AI age, ask yourself: Will you be the one <u>owning</u> the machine (or
                creating with it), or the one <u>replaced</u> by it?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 3: 
            <h3>The Two Possible Futures (Then and Now)</h3>

            During the Industrial Revolution, workers had two paths:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            1. <u>Resistance without adaptation</u> — Many resisted machines. They fought, they protested, but machines
            marched on. Resistance without adaptation only delayed the inevitable.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            2. <u>Adaptation with upskilling</u> — Some workers learned to operate, maintain, or design machines. They
            became more valuable. Instead of being displaced, they became the new elite labor.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In today's world:<br>
            <p>* A lawyer who resists AI contracts will soon lose out to firms that use AI to draft them 100x faster.<br>
                * A lawyer who <u>masters</u> AI-assisted contract design won't be replaced — they'll become more powerful.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            The lesson: **AI is today's machine. You can resist it or you can learn to ride it.**
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 4: <h3>The Career Story of</h3><h4>“Mr. Capital and Ms. Labor”</h4>

            Let me personify this.<br>

            <u>Mr. Capital:</u> In the 1800s, he bought machines. Today, he buys AI tools, invests in startups, builds
            scalable products. He compounds wealth.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Ms. Labor:</u> In the 1800s, she worked the looms. Today, she codes, teaches, consults, or manages
            projects. She trades hours for wages.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            In the Industrial Revolution, Ms. Labor was trapped in long hours, low pay, and constant fear of
            replacement. Meanwhile, Mr. Capital sat at the top, his machines multiplying wealth.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Today, unless you learn how to transform your skills into assets, you may find yourself as Ms. Labor again —
            except this time, your competitor isn't a steam engine. It's an AI that doesn't sleep.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 5: <h3>Historical Echoes in Modern Professions</h3>

            <h4>Weavers → Programmers</h4>
            In the 1800s, weavers were replaced by textile machines. Today, programmers writing routine code are being
            replaced by AI that can generate code in seconds.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Typists → Knowledge Workers</h4>
            In the 1900s, millions worked as typists. Computers erased that career in a decade. Today, millions of
            lawyers, analysts, and marketers may see AI eat into their roles.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Factory Hands → Office Hands</h4>
            Factories needed fewer hands once machines arrived. Offices will need fewer clerks, analysts, and managers
            as AI automates knowledge work.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 6: <h3>The Student's Career Dilemma</h3>

            You, sitting here as a future professional, are asking: <h4>Will my career survive AI?</h4>

            The honest answer: <u> Not in its old form.</u>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Just as no 18th-century weaver could survive by insisting on weaving by hand, you cannot survive by
            insisting your profession remain untouched. The only way forward is transformation.

            Ask yourself:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <p>* Am I learning to <u>use AI as a tool</u>?<br>
                * Am I building <u>assets</u> (knowledge, systems, networks) that AI amplifies rather than replaces?<br>
                * Am I thinking like <u>Mr. Capital</u>, even if I start as Ms. Labor?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Part 7: <h4>The Hopeful Side — Labor Can Still Win</h4>

            Here's the good news. During the Industrial Revolution, new professions emerged that no one could have
            predicted: machine engineers, factory managers, industrial designers.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Similarly, in the AI age, new professions are being born right now:

            * :AI ethicists:<br>
            * :Prompt engineers:<br>
            * :AI auditors:<br>
            * :AI product designers:<br>
            * :Human-AI interaction specialists:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            These didn't exist five years ago. Many of your future careers don't exist yet either.<br>

            Your job is not to cling to the old but to <h4>spot the new before others do.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Exercise</h3>

            1. Pick the profession you are aiming for.<br>
            2. Imagine how an AI could replace 80% of what you plan to do. Be brutally honest.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. Now, ask: <h4>What new roles will appear because of this? </h4>Where can a human add value that AI cannot?

            <u>Example:</u> A teacher might lose the job of delivering lectures ...
        </div><div class="slide">
            but gain the role of being a learning coach, mentor, or designer of AI-driven personalized learning.<br>
            <u>Example:</u> An accountant might lose routine data entry but gain a role as a financial strategist who works
            with AI outputs.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>

            If you lived in the Industrial Revolution, would you have smashed the machines or learned to build them?

            What about today — will you resist AI or master it?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Closing Remark</h4>

            The Industrial Revolution showed us that machines don't just replace labor; they redefine it. Some were
            crushed, others adapted, and a few built empires.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In the AI age, the same choice is in front of you. <h4>Be labor, and risk being replaced.</h4><h3>Or transform, and
                become the one who shapes the future.</h3>

            Your career survival depends on which side of that divide you choose.
