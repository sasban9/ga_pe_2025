            Module 2: <h3>The Industrial Age Legacy</h3>

            <h4>Learning Goal</h4>

            To see how the Industrial Revolution transformed the relationship between capital and labor, reshaping
            societies, economies, and even human identity — and to understand how those changes echo in today’s AI
            debates.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Lecture Narrative</h4>

            The Industrial Revolution was not just about machines — it was about a reorganization of human life around
            the needs of capital. Before it, most people worked on farms, in small workshops, or in family businesses.
            Labor and life were interwoven. But factories broke that bond.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Factories required discipline, scale, and coordination. Workers no longer decided when to start or stop.
            Bells, whistles, and clock towers dictated the rhythm of life. A new class of labor was born: <u>the wage
                worker.</u> Time itself became a commodity.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Capital, meanwhile, took a new form: massive investments in machinery, steam engines, textile mills,
            railroads. Owners of factories had the leverage of scale — machines amplified their capital far beyond the
            strength of any one worker.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Suddenly, the gap widened:<br> one capitalist could command the labor of hundreds.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            The Industrial Age also created new struggles. Workers demanded rights, unions formed, and revolutions shook
            nations. Laws around child labor, working hours, and safety came only after long battles. The state, at
            times siding with capital, at times with labor, became an arbitrator.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Yet, despite the struggles, the system endured — because both capital and labor needed each other. Factories
            could not run without workers. Workers could not live without wages. This uneasy truce defined the 19th and
            20th centuries.

            Key Concepts to Explore

            <h3>1. The Mechanization of Labor</h3>

            * Workers became replaceable units.<br>
            * Skills were devalued — machines could outpace artisans.<br>
            * The rise of “alienation”: humans disconnected from the products they made.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>2. The Birth of the Wage System</h4>

            * Time → Money.<br>
            * Labor sold in hours, not in goods or results.<br>
            * The psychological shift: identity tied to being a “worker.”
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>3. Capital Intensification</h4>

            * Steam, electricity, assembly lines.<br>
            * Factories as monuments of capital.<br>
            * Owners’ wealth compounding exponentially, while wages stagnated.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>4. Labor Movements and Rights</h4>

            * Unions, strikes, and collective bargaining.<br>
            * Political ideologies: socialism, communism, anarchism — all responses to capital’s dominance.<br>
            * Labor laws that reshaped modern society: minimum wage, 8-hour day, weekends.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>5. The Industrial Middle Class</h4>

            * Engineers, managers, clerks emerged — labor adjacent to capital.<br>
            * The first hints that knowledge, not just muscle, could improve bargaining power.

            <img src="https://marketinginsidergroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Where-Do-Case-Studies-Fit-into-Your-Content-Marketing-Strategy-1.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Case 1: The Luddites (1811 - 1816)</h4>
            Skilled textile workers in England smashed machines that displaced their labor. Their rebellion showed the
            first mass anxiety about technology replacing human work — a debate still alive today with AI.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Case 2: Fordism and the Assembly Line</h4>
            Henry Ford’s moving assembly line revolutionized productivity. Labor was broken into repetitive tasks,
            stripping skill but increasing efficiency. Ford also paid higher wages, understanding that laborers also
            needed to be consumers.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Case 3: Coal Miners vs Barons</h4>
            From Britain to the US, mining towns showed stark divides. Owners built mansions while miners lived in
            shacks, often paid in “company currency.” Labor strikes in these industries sometimes turned violent,
            exposing the raw conflict between capital and labor.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>

            Imagine being a skilled craftsman in 1820, suddenly replaced by a factory machine. What would you feel —
            anger, despair, resignation, or opportunity? How does that compare to a knowledge worker today facing AI
            automation?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Exercise</h4>

            1. Map your own family's history. Where were they during the Industrial Age (farmers, traders, factory
            workers, officials)?<br>
            2. Identify how capital vs labor shaped their lives.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. Discuss: Did they experience upward mobility through capital accumulation (land, business, education) or
            remain within cycles of labor?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>

            Factories created a strange paradox: they destroyed old forms of labor but also created millions of new
            jobs. With AI, do we expect a similar paradox — or will AI truly eliminate more jobs than it creates?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Closing Thought</h4>

            The Industrial Age was a contract between capital and labor: *you give me your time, I give you wages.* It
            worked for 200 years. The question we now face is: does AI break this contract entirely?
