            Let's move now to Module 5: <h4>New Forms of Labor</h4> since this is the heart of the course where the
            conversation shifts from history and critique to possibility and experimentation.

            Module 5: <h3>New Forms of Labor</h3>
            <h4>Learning Goal</h4>
            To examine how labor is transforming in the age of AI, what new models of work are emerging, 
        </div><div class="slide">
            and whether any of them allow labor to behave more like capital — scalable, repeatable, and compounding.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Lecture Narrative</h4>

            For most of human history, labor meant physical toil. In the industrial age, it meant routine factory work.
            In the digital age, it meant knowledge work: coding, designing, analyzing, communicating.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Now, in the AI age, the definition of labor is expanding and splintering.
            Some jobs disappear as machines take over routine tasks. Others shift shape as workers collaborate with
            algorithms. </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Still others emerge in entirely new forms, where labor is no longer just hours spent, but
            identity expressed, creativity shared, or data generated.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            This module explores those <u>new categories of labor</u> — from gig workers managed by invisible AI bosses, to
            creators building audiences as assets, to professionals who turn their expertise into scalable, digital
            products.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Key Themes

            <h4>1. The Gig Economy and Algorithmic Bosses</h4>

            * Platforms like <u>Uber, Swiggy, or Amazon Mechanical Turk</u> mediate labor through AI-driven systems.<br>
            * Workers gain flexibility but lose security.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            * The algorithm sets the price, not the worker.<br>
            * Labor becomes “taskified” — chopped into small, on-demand units.<br>
            * Question: Is this labor liberation or digital feudalism?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>2. The Creator Economy</h4>

            * Platforms like <u>YouTube, TikTok, and Substack</u> reward creativity and personal brand.<br>
            * Labor shifts from tasks to personality — uniqueness itself becomes the product.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            * Audiences act as compounding capital: once built, they keep generating income.
            * Challenge: extreme inequality (few succeed, many fail).
        </div><div class="slide">
            <h4>3. Augmented Labor: AI as Co-pilot</h4>

            * Workers no longer compete directly with AI; they collaborate.<br>
            * Example: A lawyer uses AI to draft contracts but adds human judgment.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            * Example: A teacher creates lessons with AI but adds emotional connection.<br>
            * Here, productivity multiplies — but the question remains: who captures the surplus, the worker or the
            platform?
        </div><div class="slide">
            <h4>4. Can Labor Compound Like Capital?</h4>

            * Traditional labor: hours disappear once spent.<br>
            * New labor: digital products, online courses, books, AI-trained workflows — they can earn repeatedly after
            creation.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            * Reputation, networks, and intellectual property become semi-capital assets.<br>
            * AI accelerates this: your skill, encoded once, can keep generating value.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <!-- ### **Case Studies** -->

            <h4>Case 1: The Uber Driver</h4>
            Rides are allocated by an algorithm. Prices surge based on machine predictions. The driver is “free,” yet
            has no power. Labor is fragmented and temporary, unable to compound.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Case 2: The YouTube Educator</h4>
            A teacher records videos once, uploads them, and they generate ad revenue for years. The teacher’s labor
            becomes an asset — scalable and semi-capitalized. Success depends on audience compounding.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Case 3: The AI-Assisted Freelancer</h4>
            A graphic designer leverages AI to create drafts quickly. The AI multiplies productivity, allowing more
            clients and faster delivery. The designer keeps the relational and creative edge. Labor here is augmented,
            not replaced.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>
            Think about your current form of labor. Does it vanish the moment you stop working, or does it continue to
            generate value? What would it take for your labor to “compound” like capital?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Exercise
            <h4>Design two scenarios for yourself:</h4>
            1. A labor model where you only trade hours for wages (traditional).<br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. A labor model where you create something once (a course, a tool, a digital product, a process) that can
            generate income repeatedly.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Now compare: what are the barriers keeping you from shifting from (1) to (2)?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>
            “Are we entering an age where labor and capital merge — where the worker can own a piece of the machine, the
            brand, or the audience they build? Or will new forms of labor just disguise old inequalities?”
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This module is designed to <u>pivot the student from historical analysis to personal strategy,</u> asking
            them
            to see their own labor choices in light of capital's compounding logic.
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="slide">
            Would you like me to **also design a practical toolkit** here — a set of step-by-step strategies for
            students to start turning their own labor into “semi-capital” (digital assets, AI-powered workflows,
            scalable products)?
