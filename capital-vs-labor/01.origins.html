            Perfect — let’s go deep into **Module 1: The Origins of Capital and Labor** and make it both intellectually
            rich and personally thought-provoking.

            Module 1: <h2>The Origins of Capital and Labor</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Learning Goal</h3>

            To understand where the tension between capital and labor begins, why it shapes every society, and why its
            roots matter in the age of AI.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Lecture Narrative</h3>
            Before money, before banks, before stock markets, there was labor. A hunter went into the forest, caught
            prey, and brought it home. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            A farmer sowed seeds, harvested crops, and ate or traded the surplus. Labor was
            survival, immediate and perishable: the moment you stopped working, you stopped producing.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Capital came later, as stored value. The extra grain a farmer kept in his granary was not just food — it was
            security, leverage, and potential trade. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Over time, this surplus could be loaned, invested, or used to build
            tools and structures that multiplied future productivity. That was the spark of capital: stored labor that
            compounded.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            The earliest civilizations — Mesopotamia, Egypt, Indus Valley, China — all reveal this pattern. Farmers,
            artisans, and builders contributed labor, while rulers, priests, and merchants accumulated capital in the
            form of land, grain, metals, or later, currency. Labor kept people alive. Capital created dynasties.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            The asymmetry was clear. Labor ended with the day. Capital carried forward across generations. The Pharaoh’s
            pyramid still stood after the workers were gone. The merchant’s gold still grew after the sailor’s voyage
            ended. That is the original divide.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Key Concepts to Explore</h3>

            <h4>1. Labor as Perishable</h4>

            * Labor is tied to time and body.<br>
            * No compounding: one day of rest is one day of lost production.<br>
            * Labor must constantly renew itself.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            2. <h4>Capital as Accumulated Labor</h4>

            * Surplus transforms into stored value.<br>
            * Tools, infrastructure, and savings multiply future output.<br>
            * Capital compounds: a plough makes tomorrow's labor more effective than today's.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            3. <h4>Early Inequalities</h4>

            * Who owned surplus? Landlords, chiefs, kings.<br>
            * Who labored? Farmers, artisans, slaves.<br>
            * Hierarchies and social classes emerged from this divide.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            4. <h4>The Idea of Compoundability</h4>

            * Why capital grows faster than labor.<br>
            * The Matthew Effect: “the rich get richer.”<br>
            * Generational wealth: foresight of ancestors keeps rewarding descendants.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Case 1: <h4>Mesopotamian Grain Banks</h4>
            Clay tablets record farmers depositing surplus grain into temples. These temples became early banks, lending
            grain (capital) at interest. Farmers worked the fields, but temples multiplied wealth.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Case 2: <h4>Roman Slavery vs Roman Patricians</h4>
            Slaves' labor built roads, aqueducts, and villas. Patricians accumulated capital from this labor, passing
            wealth down centuries. Labor disappeared with death; capital became eternal.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
            Case 3: <h3>The Tea Estate Owner vs The Worker (Modern Continuity)</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In colonial India, tea estates and mines were set up by capital-rich elites. Generations later, the
            descendants of owners still collect profits. Workers, meanwhile, continue to trade time for wages, trapped
            in non-compounding labor.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>

            If your grandparents had left you not land or money, but a skill, would that be closer to labor or to
            capital? Where do intangible assets — like knowledge, reputation, and networks — fit in this early story?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Exercise</h4>

            1. Take an example from your own life where you are doing pure labor (trading time for money or results).<br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. Take another example where something you built in the past (a tool, a piece of work, a connection) keeps
            giving you returns today.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. Compare them. Which one feels like capital? Which one feels like labor?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>

            “Is labor always condemned to perish, or can it be designed to compound?”
            This is the seed question that foreshadows AI’s role later in the course —             
        </div>
        <div class="slide">- because AI may allow labor to
            finally become repeatable, scalable, and semi-capitalized!
