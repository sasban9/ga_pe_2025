            Got it — let's fully flesh out **Module 3: The Digital Revolution** in the same rich, flowing way we did for
            Module 1.
        </div> -->
        <div class="slide">

            Module 3: <h3>The Digital Revolution</h3>

            <h4>Learning Goal</h4>

            To examine how computers, the internet, and platforms transformed the balance of power between capital and
            labor, and why this shift laid the foundation for today's AI-driven inequalities.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Lecture Narrative</h4>

            The Industrial Age was about machines that amplified muscle. The Digital Age is about machines that amplify
            mind. With the arrival of computers, labor was no longer just about hands on a factory floor. A new figure
            emerged: <u>the knowledge worker</u>.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            In the mid-20th century, the promise of digital tools looked hopeful for labor. A programmer could write
            software once and license it many times. 
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            An accountant with a spreadsheet could handle tasks that once
            required an entire clerical department. A designer with Photoshop could create more in a week than a team
            with paintbrushes and stencils.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            Labor seemed to move “up the value chain,” closer to creativity, strategy, and decision-making — areas
            supposedly safe from automation. But even as individual workers gained efficiency, capital quietly
            consolidated.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Why? Because digital technology has near-zero marginal cost of replication. Writing software is labor — but
            once written, it becomes capital. The first copy takes effort, the millionth copy costs almost nothing. This
            gave rise to a new class of capitalists: the platform owners.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Google does not pay per search. Facebook does not pay per post. Amazon does not pay per listing. Instead,
            they extract and aggregate the labor of billions of users, then monetize it at scale. Labor creates content,
            attention, and data, but capital captures the compounding returns.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            The asymmetry widened further because unlike factories, digital platforms are “winner-takes-most.” Network
            effects ensure that once one platform dominates, competitors fade.
        </div><div class="slide"> 
            Labor became dispersed, fragmented, and
            replaceable. Capital became concentrated, compounding, and untouchable.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            By the 2010s, we had entered a new era where the average worker still traded hours for wages, while a
            handful of founders, investors, and platform owners watched their capital compound into trillions. The old
            industrial inequalities repeated themselves — only faster, sharper, and more global.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Key Concepts to Explore</h3>
            <h4>1. Knowledge Work as the New Labor</h4>

            * Rise of programmers, designers, analysts, consultants.<br>
            * Labor shifts from muscle to mind.<br>
            * Promise of higher wages, more autonomy, intellectual prestige.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>2. Software as Capital</h4>

            * Code is labor once, capital forever.<br>
            * Zero marginal cost of digital reproduction.<br>
            * IP (intellectual property) as the new factory machine.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>3. Platforms as Capital Accumulators</h4>

            * Network effects: the more users, the more value.<br>
            * Two-sided markets (Uber, Airbnb, YouTube).<br>
            * Platforms extract labor (content, driving, hosting) but retain compounding value.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>4. Algorithmic Inequality</h4>

            * Algorithms amplify attention, not fairness.<br>
            * Data becomes a form of labor — collected for free, owned by capital.<br>
            * The shift from “you are the worker” to “you are the product.”

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Case Studies</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Case 1: Microsoft and the Software Revolution</h4>
            Bill Gates licensed MS-DOS and Windows to computer manufacturers. Each licensing deal was labor leveraged
            into infinite replication — labor turning directly into compounding capital.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Case 2: YouTube Creators vs YouTube Inc.</h4>
            Creators provide labor — filming, editing, entertaining. YouTube provides the platform. Most creators earn
            modestly, but the platform (capital) earns billions, compounding with every video upload.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Case 3: Amazon's Marketplace</h4>
            Sellers labor to source, market, and ship products. Amazon owns the infrastructure and data, taking cuts and
            gathering intelligence. Sellers may survive; Amazon thrives.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>

            When you use a digital platform, are you a laborer (creating, posting, rating), a capitalist (owning,
            investing, building tools), or a product (being tracked and monetized)? Can you be all three at once?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Exercise</h3>

            1. Think of one digital tool you use at work (e.g., Excel, Canva, Slack).<hr>

            * How does it save you labor?<br>
            * How does it transfer power to the tool's owner as capital?
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. Imagine you build something digital today (a course, an app, a newsletter).<hr>

            * At what point does your labor stop being labor and start becoming capital?

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>Discussion Starter</h4>

            “Did the digital revolution liberate labor by giving us powerful tools, or did it enslave labor further by
            concentrating capital into fewer hands?”

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This sets up the next leap: if the digital era concentrated capital so strongly, what happens in <h4>the AI Era,</h4> where even knowledge work — once thought safe — can be automated?

        </div>
