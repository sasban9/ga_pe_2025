            Great — Module 7 is where the course gets political, ethical, and deeply relevant to current debates. Let’s expand it in the same style as Module 1 so it can stand alone as a full lecture + reflection + exercise unit.

            # **Module 7: Ethics, Power, and Policy**

### **Learning Goal**

To explore the ethical dilemmas, power struggles, and policy questions that arise when AI tilts the balance of capital and labor, and to examine possible frameworks societies can adopt to prevent collapse or injustice.
</div><div class="slide">
### **Lecture Narrative**

Every technological leap reshuffles society’s balance of power. The steam engine disrupted feudal hierarchies, the assembly line empowered industrial capitalists, and the internet concentrated wealth in platform monopolies. With AI, we may face an even sharper concentration: capital is no longer just machines and money, but also intelligence itself.
</div><div class="slide">

The ethical question is stark: if a small number of corporations or governments own the most advanced AI systems, does labor have any bargaining power left? When algorithms can outthink and outproduce workers, labor may not just be underpaid — it may become irrelevant.
</div><div class="slide">

Policy becomes the battlefield. Do governments regulate AI like nuclear power, ensuring safety and broad access? Or do they deregulate, letting capital run wild in search of innovation and dominance? 
</div><div class="slide">
    Do we tax AI-driven wealth and distribute it, or let “trickle-down automation” play out? The stakes are global: inequality, migration, political unrest, even social collapse.
</div><div class="slide">

But there’s also a moral lens. If wealth is created by machines, who deserves it? The owners of the machines? The society whose data trained them? The workers displaced by them? Or humanity as a whole?
</div><div class="slide">

This is where ideologies re-emerge in new forms: techno-socialism, AI-feudalism, digital libertarianism, or hybrid models of shared ownership. The choices we make in this decade will determine whether AI creates a renaissance or a dystopia.
</div><div class="slide">
### **Key Concepts to Explore**

**1. Concentration of AI Power**

* A handful of corporations and states control frontier AI models.
* Data, compute, and algorithms as the new “oil fields.”
* Network effects lock in advantages for early winners.
</div><div class="slide">

**2. The End of Labor’s Bargaining Power?**

* Collective bargaining worked when human labor was essential.
* When labor is optional, unions lose leverage.
* “Ghost work” and invisible digital labor behind AI (labelers, moderators).
</div><div class="slide">

**3. Ethical Dilemmas**

* Who owns AI-generated wealth?
* Is it ethical for capital to profit infinitely while labor shrinks?
* Are workers entitled to compensation when their data trains models?
</div><div class="slide">

<h4>4. Policy Choices</h4>

* Taxation: robot taxes, AI wealth taxes, data dividends.<br>
* Redistribution: universal basic income (UBI) or universal basic capital (UBC).<br>
* Regulation: limiting monopolies, mandating open-source models, global treaties.<br>
* Innovation vs fairness: how do you avoid choking progress while preventing collapse?
</div><div class="slide">

<h4>5. Ideologies Reborn</h4>

* **Techno-Socialism:** AI wealth is shared across society.
* **Techno-Feudalism:** A few mega-corporations become digital landlords, workers reduced to digital serfs.
* **Digital Libertarianism:** Minimal state interference; individuals free to leverage AI if they can.
* **Commons Model:** AI seen as a collective good, like air or oceans, owned by humanity.

<!-- ### **Case Studies** -->

<h3>Case 1: Robot Taxes in Europe</h3>
The EU and some Nordic countries debated taxing robots to slow automation and fund social security. Critics argued it would stifle innovation; proponents said it would buy time for displaced workers.
</div><div class="slide">

<h3>Case 2: Universal Basic Income (Finland Experiment)</h3>
Finland’s pilot UBI provided citizens with a fixed monthly stipend. Results: modest improvements in well-being, but mixed on job-seeking. Raises the question: in an AI future, should income be tied to work at all?
</div><div class="slide">

<h3>Case 3: Techno-Feudalism in Platforms</h3>
Gig workers on platforms like Uber or Mechanical Turk illustrate digital serfdom: laborers depend on algorithms, have no bargaining power, and create wealth that disproportionately flows upward to platform owners.
</div><div class="slide">
<h4>Reflection Prompt</h4>

If AI makes your job redundant, should society owe you compensation — because you were displaced — or opportunity — because you now have freedom to explore other pursuits? Which feels more ethical: compensation or liberation?
</div><div class="slide">
Exercise

<h4>1. Imagine you are a policy advisor to your government in 2030. AI has displaced 40% of routine jobs. Design a policy response in one page. Will you:</h4>
</div><div class="slide">

   * Redistribute wealth (UBI, welfare, taxation)?<br>
   * Empower new forms of labor (education, entrepreneurship)?<br>
   * Break up AI monopolies?<br>
   * Do nothing and trust markets to adjust?
</div><div class="slide">
    2. Present your policy in class and debate. Who wins, who loses under your model?
</div><div class="slide">
### **Discussion Starter**

“If capital owns intelligence itself, is labor obsolete — or does labor simply need to redefine itself?”
</div><div class="slide">
Would you like me to **tie Module 7 back to Module 1** (origins of labor and capital) so the narrative feels like a historical arc coming full circle by the time we hit Module 8? That way, students see the course as a continuous story, not isolated modules.
