            <!-- Absolutely, let's unpack that specific point: "A design philosophy or principle you resonate with." -->

            <h2>What it means to include this:</h2>

            <p>This isn't about you being a professional designer (unless you are, of course!).</p><hr>
            <p>It's about showcasing your appreciation for how things are made, how problems are solved creatively, and
                how intentionality shapes our interactions with the world. It reveals:</p>

            <b>Thoughtfulness and critical observation</b><br> You don't just consume products or experiences; you think
                about <u>WHY</u> they are designed the way they are.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p><b>Problem-solving aptitude:</b> Design, at its core, is about solving problems â€“ whether it's making a
                complex app intuitive, a chair comfortable, or a city livable. Resonating with a design philosophy implies
                you appreciate this problem-solving aspect.</p>

            <p><b>Aesthetic and functional appreciation:</b> You value both the beauty and the utility of well-designed
                things.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p><b>Ability to connect diverse fields:</b> Design principles often transcend specific domains. By picking one,
                you show you can identify common threads across different areas.</p>
        </div><div class="slide" style="background: url(https://unlimited.hamk.fi/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jussila-et-al_Design-thinking_mainimage_AdobeStock_624636615.jpg) 50% 50%;background-size: cover;">
            <p style="background: #fffc;padding: 1rem;width: 50vw;color: #333;"><b>Potential for innovative thinking:</b> People who appreciate design often bring a fresh perspective to
                their own work, thinking about elegance, efficiency, and user experience.</p>

            <h3>How to "unpack" it in your video introduction <!--(i.e., what to say/show):--></h3>
            <p>1. <b>Name the philosophy/principle:</b> Be specific. Don't just say "good design."</p>
            <!-- <p>* **Example options:**</p> -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p><b>Minimalism:</b> Less is more; focusing on essential elements.</p>
            <p><b>User-Centric Design (UCD):</b> Designing with the user's needs, behaviors, and motivations at the
            forefront.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/f6/11/03f6113543c91710e3bf577f5ca2b904.gif" align="right" alt=""><b>Biomimicry:</b> Innovation inspired by nature's designs and processes. <br>
                <b>Affordance:</b> The design of an object should suggest how it is used (e.g., a door handle that looks like
            it should be pulled).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p><b>Fitts's Law (in UI/UX):</b> The time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to
                and size of the target. (A bit more technical, but shows depth if relevant to your field).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" style="background: linear-gradient(#0000,#020), url(https://calibroworkspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1_sq6sXe56-s7oPUEht_cwQ-1500x760.jpeg);background-size: cover;">
            <p><b>Inclusive Design:</b> Designing for the widest possible range of human diversity.</p>
            <p><b>Sustainable Design:</b> Designing products, services, and systems to minimize environmental impact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p><b>"Form follows function" (Louis Sullivan):</b> The shape of a building or object should primarily be based
            upon its intended function or purpose.</p>
            <p><b>"Good design is as little design as possible" (Dieter Rams):</b> Part of his 10 principles of good design.</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <h3>2. Briefly define it (in your own words):</h3> 
            <p><img src="https://elementor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021_11_Herding_Cats_for_animation.gif" height="200" align="left" alt="">Show you understand it, don't just quote a definition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>3. Explain <u>WHY</u> you resonate with it:</h3>
            <p>This is the crucial part.</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p><b>Connect it to your interests:</b> "I'm drawn to <b style="font-family: monospace;background: crimson;color: white;">MINIMALISM</b> because I believe elegance often lies in
                simplicity and the removal of clutter, which is something I strive for in my code architecture/data
                visualizations/research papers."</p>
        </div><div class="slide">
            <p><b>Provide a specific example:</b> "I'm fascinated by <u>Biomimicry</u>. For instance, the way engineers are
                studying the structure of abalone shells to create stronger ceramics, or how Velcro was inspired by burrs.
                It shows how elegant and optimized solutions can come from observing natural processes."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p><b>Relate it to a problem:</b> "The principle of <u>UCD</u> deeply resonates with me. I've seen
                too many software applications that are technically brilliant but frustrating to use because the user wasn't
                at the heart of the design process. I believe placing the user first leads to truly impactful solutions."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" style="background: url(https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/32/24/48/360_F_232244890_8CJ7VJAU79lhGHg8D19Ch9JrfUCYOn7M.jpg) 50% 50%;background-size: cover;">
            <p><b>Discuss its broader implications:</b> "I admire the concept of <u>Inclusive Design</u> because it forces us
            to think beyond the 'average' user and consider the diverse needs of everyone. This kind of thoughtful
            consideration for accessibility and equity is something I believe is vital in all fields, not just design."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>It's the idea of looking to nature for solutions to human challenges. For me, it highlights
                how millions of years of evolution have already optimized systems for efficiency and resilience. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>I find it
                incredibly inspiring to think about how we can apply these natural 'algorithms' â€“ whether it's in designing
                more sustainable systems, optimizing logistical flows,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <p>or even building more robust machine learning models
                â€“ by observing the elegance of nature's designs. It's a testament to thoughtful creation and problem-solving
                at its finest."</p>
