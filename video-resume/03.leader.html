    <p>Explain Why They Inspire You (The Crucial Part): <small>This is where you connect their work to your own values

        Approach/Methodology: "I'm inspired by Dr. Jane Goodall's patience and immersive approach to understanding
        chimpanzee behavior, spending years observing them in their natural habitat <small>rather than imposing
            artificial conditions. This dedication to authentic, long-term observation deeply resonates with my belief
            in thorough data collection and understanding complex systems holistically."</small></div>

    <div class="blur">Impact/Vision: "I'm inspired by Elon Musk's audacious vision to tackle some of humanity's biggest challenges,
        like sustainable energy and multi-planetary existence. <small>While his methods are often debated, his
            willingness to push boundaries and pursue seemingly impossible goals with a long-term perspective is
            something I find incredibly motivating when thinking about how technology can solve global
            problems."</small></div>

    <div class="blur">Perspective/Philosophy: "The work of Brené Brown profoundly inspires me, particularly her research on
        vulnerability and courageous leadership. <small>She has shifted my perspective on the importance of embracing
            imperfection and showing up authentically, which I believe is crucial not just for personal growth but also
            for building strong, innovative teams in any professional setting."</small></div>

        Creativity/Innovation: "As a data scientist, I might not seem directly related to Hayao Miyazaki's work, but I
        am deeply inspired by his unparalleled creativity <small>and his ability to build entire worlds with intricate
            details and profound emotional depth. His commitment to environmental themes and the power of storytelling,
            even in animation, reminds me of the importance of imagination and ethical considerations in all forms of
            creation, including how we present data."</small></div>

    <div class="blur">Problem-Solving: "I'm particularly drawn to Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming. Her famous quote,
        'It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission,' <small>speaks to a bold, experimental approach to
            problem-solving and innovation that I admire. She wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo to advance the
            field."</small></div>
    <h4>Why This is Effective:</h4>

        <li class="blur">Demonstrates Depth: <small>You're not just consuming information; you're reflecting on it and drawing
                inspiration.</small></li>
        <li class="blur">Provides Talking Points: <small>It can spark further conversation about your broader interests during an
                interview.</small></li>
        <li class="blur">Shows Alignment: <small>If the person you choose aligns with the company's or program's values, it's a
                subtle but effective way to demonstrate fit.</small></li>
