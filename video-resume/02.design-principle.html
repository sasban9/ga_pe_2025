            This isn't about you being a professional designer (unless you are, of course!). It's about showcasing your
            appreciation for how things are made, how problems are solved creatively, and how intentionality shapes our
            interactions with the world. It reveals:

        <div class="slide">
            <!-- <b>What it means to include this:</b> -->

            <b>Thoughtfulness and critical observation:</b> <!--You don't just consume products or experiences;--> you think
            about <u>WHY</u> they are designed the way they are.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Problem-solving aptitude:</b> Design, at its core, is about solving problems
             <!-- – whether it's making a complex app intuitive, a chair comfortable, or a city livable.  -->
            <!-- Resonating with a design philosophy implies you appreciate this problem-solving aspect. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Aesthetic and functional appreciation:</b> 
            <!-- You value both the beauty and the utility of well-designed things. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Ability to connect diverse fields:</b> 
            <!-- Design principles often transcend specific domains. By picking            one, you show you can identify common threads across different areas. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Potential for innovative thinking:</b> 
            <!-- People who appreciate design often bring a fresh perspective to   their own work, thinking about elegance, efficiency, and user experience. -->

            <h4>How to "unpack" it in your video introduction<br> (i.e., what to say/show)</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Name the philosophy/principle:</h3> Be specific. Don't just say "good design."
            <hr>
            <b>Example options:</b>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Minimalism:</b> Less is more; focusing on essential elements.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>User-Centric Design (UCD):</b> Designing with the user's needs, behaviors, and motivations at the
            forefront.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Biomimicry:</b> Innovation inspired by nature's designs and processes.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Affordance:</b> The design of an object should suggest how it is used (e.g., a door handle that looks
            like it should be pulled).
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Fitts's Law (in UI/UX):</b> The time required to move to a target area is a function of the distance to
            and size of the target. (A bit more technical, but shows depth if relevant to your field).
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Inclusive Design:</b> Designing for the widest possible range of human diversity.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Sustainable Design:</b> Designing products, services, and systems to minimize environmental impact.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>"Form follows function" (Louis Sullivan):</b> The shape of a building or object should primarily be based
            upon its intended function or purpose.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>"Good design is as little design as possible" (Dieter Rams):</b> Part of his 10 principles of good
            design.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>2. Briefly define it (in your own words):</h4> Show you understand it, don't just quote a definition.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. <b>Explain *why* you resonate with it:</b> This is the crucial part.
            <br>* <b>Connect it to your interests:</b> "I'm drawn to </b>Minimalism</b> because I believe elegance often
            lies in simplicity and the removal of clutter, which is something I strive for in my code architecture/data
            visualizations/research papers."
            <br>* <b>Provide a specific example:</b> "I'm fascinated by </b>Biomimicry</b>. For instance, the way
            engineers are studying the structure of abalone shells to create stronger ceramics, or how Velcro was
            inspired by burrs. It shows how elegant and optimized solutions can come from observing natural processes."
            <br>* <b>Relate it to a problem:</b> "The principle of </b>User-Centric Design</b> deeply resonates with me.
            I've seen too many software applications that are technically brilliant but frustrating to use because the
            user wasn't at the heart of the design process. I believe placing the user first leads to truly impactful
            solutions."
            <br>* <b>Discuss its broader implications:</b> "I admire the concept of </b>Inclusive Design</b> because it
            forces us to think beyond the 'average' user and consider the diverse needs of everyone. This kind of
            thoughtful consideration for accessibility and equity is something I believe is vital in all fields, not
            just design."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Example snippet for your video:</h3>
            "Beyond my deep dive into the latest LLM architectures, I'm also really captivated by the philosophy of
            </b>Biomimicry</b>. It's the idea of looking to nature for solutions to human challenges. For me, it
            highlights how millions of years of evolution have already optimized systems for efficiency and resilience.
            I find it incredibly inspiring to think about how we can apply these natural 'algorithms' – whether it's in
            designing more sustainable systems, optimizing logistical flows, or even building more robust machine
            learning models – by observing the elegance of nature's designs. It's a testament to thoughtful creation and
            problem-solving at its finest."

            By doing this, you're not just listing a concept; you're demonstrating your intellectual curiosity, your
            capacity for critical thought, and how you draw connections between seemingly disparate fields.
