            <h3>A thought leader or innovator whose work inspires you.</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            This element in your video introduction is a powerful way to reveal more about yourself than just your
            technical skills. It's a window into your <u>values, aspirations, intellectual curiosities, and even your
                potential approach to challenges.</u>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>What it Communicates About You:</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            1. <u>Your Values and Principles:</u> The *why* behind your admiration often aligns with your own core
            beliefs.
            <!-- Do you value innovation, ethics, perseverance, collaboration, radical thinking, or societal impact? Your choice and explanation will reveal this. -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. <u>Intellectual Curiosities:</u> It shows what kind of ideas or challenges you're drawn to, even if
            they're outside your immediate domain.
            <!-- Are you inspired by scientific discovery, business disruption, artistic expression, or philosophical depth? -->
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            3. <u>Aspiration and Growth Mindset:</u> Identifying someone you admire indicates you're looking up to
            excellence and are likely driven to learn, grow, and emulate certain qualities or achievements.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            4. <u>Critical Thinking:</u> It's not just about naming someone famous; it's about articulating *why* they
            inspire you. This demonstrates your ability to analyze, synthesize, and form reasoned opinions.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            5. <u>Broad Interests:</u> By picking someone from a potentially different field (e.g., a historian if
            you're a coder, an artist if you're an engineer), you showcase a diverse range of intellectual engagement.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h4>How to "Unpack" it in Your Video Introduction <br>(What to Say/Show):</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            1. <u>Identify the Person:</u> Clearly state their name and their primary field or contribution.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Examples:</b> "Dr. Jane Goodall, the primatologist," "Brené Brown, the
            researcher and author," "Elon Musk, the entrepreneur,"  "Hayao Miyazaki, the animation director."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            2. <u>Briefly State Their Core Contribution/Work:</u> What are they known for?
            <br>* "Jane Goodall for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees..."
            <br>* "Elon Musk for his vision in electric vehicles and space exploration..."
            <br>* "Brené Brown for her work on vulnerability, courage, and shame..."
            <br>* "Hayao Miyazaki for his imaginative and environmentally conscious animated films..."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h5>3. Explain *WHY* They Inspire You (The Crucial Part):</h5><br> This is where you connect their work to your
            own values and interests. Focus on their:
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <u>Approach/Methodology:</u> "I'm inspired by <u>Dr. Jane Goodall's</u> *patience and immersive approach*
            to understanding chimpanzee behavior, spending years observing them in their natural habitat rather than
            imposing artificial conditions. This dedication to authentic, long-term observation deeply resonates with my
            belief in thorough data collection and understanding complex systems holistically."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Impact/Vision:</u> "I'm inspired by <u>Elon Musk's</u> *audacious vision* to tackle some of humanity's
            biggest challenges, like sustainable energy and multi-planetary existence. While his methods are often
            debated, his willingness to push boundaries and pursue seemingly impossible goals with a long-term
            perspective is something I find incredibly motivating when thinking about how technology can solve global
            problems."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Perspective/Philosophy:</u> "The work of <u>Brené Brown</u> profoundly inspires me, particularly her
            research on *vulnerability and courageous leadership*. She has shifted my perspective on the importance of
            embracing imperfection and showing up authentically, which I believe is crucial not just for personal growth
            but also for building strong, innovative teams in any professional setting."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Creativity/Innovation:</u> "As a data scientist, I might not seem directly related to <u>Hayao
            Miyazaki's</u> work, but I am deeply inspired by his *unparalleled creativity and his ability to build
            entire worlds with intricate details and profound emotional depth*. His commitment to environmental themes
            and the power of storytelling, even in animation, reminds me of the importance of imagination and ethical
            considerations in all forms of creation, including how we present data."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Problem-Solving:</u> "I'm particularly drawn to <u>Grace Hopper</u>, a pioneer in computer programming.
            Her famous quote, 'It's easier to ask forgiveness than permission,' speaks to a bold, experimental approach
            to problem-solving and innovation that I admire. She wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo to advance
            the field."
