        <div class="slide">

            <b>Lesson Plan (60-90 minutes):</b>
            <h3>Phase 1: Introduction & Definitions (10 minutes)</h3>

            <b>1. Warm-up Question (5 min):</b>
            <li>"Before we dive in, what comes to mind when you hear the words 'discrimination' or 'bias'?"</li>
            <li>Allow them to share their initial thoughts. This helps gauge their current understanding.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>2. Defining Key Terms (5 min):</b>
            <b>Bias:</b> "A tendency, inclination, or prejudice for or against something or someone. It can be conscious
                (explicit) or unconscious (implicit)."
            <small><b>Example:</b> "If I always assume people from a certain region are lazy, even without evidence, that's a
                bias."</small>
            <b>Prejudice:</b> "A preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience; irrational
            dislike, suspicion, or hatred of a particular group."
            <small><b>Example:</b> "Holding a negative opinion about all people of a certain religion without knowing any of them
                personally."</small>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div><b>Discrimination:</b> "The unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things,
                especially on the grounds of race, age, sex, etc. This is the <u>action</u> based on prejudice."</div>
            <small><b>Example:</b> "Refusing someone a job because of their caste, even if they are qualified."</small>
            <span><b>Analogy:</b> "Think of it like this: Bias is a thought, prejudice is a strong negative feeling based on that
                thought, and discrimination is the action taken because of that feeling."</span>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

            <h3>Phase 2: Exploring Forms & Impact of Discrimination (20-25 minutes)</h3>

            <b>1. Brainstorming Forms of Discrimination (10 min):</b>
            <li>"Discrimination can manifest in many ways and target different groups. Let's list some categories or
                grounds on which people might be discriminated against."</li>
            <li>Start with the ones you mentioned: religion, caste, gender, appearance.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <u>Encourage them to think broadly:</u>
            <div><b>Religion:</b> Discrimination based on faith or lack thereof.</div>
            <div><b>Caste:</b> (Highly relevant in India) Discrimination based on inherited social hierarchy.</div>
            <span><b>Gender:</b> Discrimination based on being male, female, or transgender.</span>
            <span><b>Appearance:</b> Based on body size, skin color, facial features, clothing, etc.</span>
            <div><b>Region/Language:</b> Discrimination against people from certain states or who speak a different language (e.g., North vs. South India, Assamese vs. Bengali speakers in certain contexts).</div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div><b>Sexual Orientation:</b> Discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals.</div>
            <span><b>Disability:</b> Discrimination against people with physical or mental disabilities.</span>
            <div><b>Socio-economic Status:</b> Discrimination based on wealth or poverty.</div>
            <span><b>Age:</b> Ageism (e.g., assuming a younger person is inexperienced or an older person is slow).</span>
            <small>Write these down clearly.</small>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>2. Impact Discussion (10-15 min):</b>
            <li>"Now that we've identified these forms, let's discuss the impact. How does discrimination affect the
                <u>individual</u> who experiences it?"</li>
            <li><b>Prompt questions:</b> Emotional toll (sadness, anger, shame), psychological impact (anxiety, depression),
                reduced opportunities (education, jobs), safety concerns, loss of dignity.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <li>"How does discrimination affect <u>society</u> as a whole?"</li>
            <li><b>Prompt questions:</b> Division, conflict, reduced productivity/innovation (loss of talent), perpetuation of stereotypes, erosion of trust, injustice, economic disparity.</li>
            <li>Emphasize that discrimination doesn't just hurt the target; it harms everyone by limiting potential and fostering negativity.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Phase 3: Being an Ally & Constructive Responses (25-30 minutes)</h3>

            <b>1. What is an Ally? (5 min):</b>
            <li>"Being an ally means actively supporting and standing up for the rights of marginalized or discriminated
                groups, even if you are not part of that group yourself."</li>
            <li>"It's about empathy â€“ putting yourself in someone else's shoes and acting on that understanding."</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>2. Brainstorming "How to Be an Ally" (10-15 min):</b>
            <li>"What are practical things we can do to be allies in our daily lives?"</li>
            <li>Guide them to think beyond just direct confrontation:</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <div><b>Educate yourself:</b> Learn about different cultures, histories, and challenges faced by various groups.
                Read books, watch documentaries.</div>
            <div><b>Listen to diverse voices:</b> Seek out and amplify the voices of those who are marginalized.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Challenge your own biases:</b> Reflect on your own stereotypes and prejudices.
            <b>Speak up (when safe):</b> Don't let prejudiced jokes or remarks go unchallenged.
            <b>Support inclusive practices:</b> Advocate for fairness in school, sports, clubs.
            <b>Be a role model:</b> Demonstrate respect and kindness to everyone.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Support affected individuals:</b> Offer comfort and solidarity to those who have experienced
            discrimination.
            <b>Report serious incidents:</b> Know who to tell (teachers, school counselors, authorities) if you witness
            or experience severe discrimination.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>3. Constructive Responses to Prejudice (Role-Playing Activity) (10-15 min):</b>
            <li>"It can be hard to know what to say or do when you hear a prejudiced remark or see an act of
                discrimination. Let's practice some responses."</li>
            <b>Introduce the "ACT" framework (or similar simple framework):</b>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b><span style="border: solid 4px;padding: 3px 10px;border-radius: 10px;">A</span>  Ask a clarifying question:</b> "What do you mean by that?" "Can you explain why you think that?"
            (Puts the burden on them to explain their prejudice).
            <b><span style="border: solid 4px;padding: 3px 10px;border-radius: 10px;">C</span> Connect with emotion:</b> "That statement makes me uncomfortable/sad." "I feel that's unfair." (Uses
            "I" statements, less confrontational).
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b><span style="border: solid 4px;padding: 3px 10px;border-radius: 10px;">T</span> Tell the truth/Educate:</b> "Actually, that's a harmful stereotype." "From my understanding, people
            from that community are very hardworking." (Provide a factual counterpoint).
            <b><span style="border: solid 4px;padding: 3px 10px;border-radius: 10px;">V</span> Vocalize boundaries:</b> "I don't find that funny." "Please don't use language like that around me."
            (Sets a clear limit).
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>Scenario Cards:</b> Write 3-4 simple, age-appropriate scenarios on index cards (e.g., "A friend makes a
            casteist joke," "Someone assumes a girl can't do well in science," "A relative comments negatively on
            someone's appearance").
            <hr>
            <b>Practice:</b> Have them pick a card and role-play how they would respond using one or more of the ACT
            strategies. Provide constructive feedback.

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Phase 4: Conclusion & Commitment (5 minutes)</h3>

            <b>1. Recap Key Learnings:</b>
            <li>"Today, we talked about different types of discrimination, their impact, and how we can be allies."</li>
            <li>Reiterate the importance of empathy, social justice, and standing up for what's right.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <b>2. Personal Commitment:</b>
            <li>"What's one thing you will try to do this week or month to be more mindful of bias or to be a better
                ally?"</li>
            <li>Encourage them to think about a specific, actionable step.</li>
            <b>3. Reinforce:</b> "It takes courage to challenge prejudice, but every small act makes a difference. Your
            voice matters."
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Tips for Facilitation:</h3>

            <li><b>Be Patient:</b> This is a sensitive topic. Allow for silence and reflection.</li>
            <li><b>Encourage Openness:</b> Create a safe space where they feel comfortable sharing honest thoughts, even
                if they're grappling with their own biases. Avoid judgment.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <li><b>Share Personal Anecdotes (Appropriately):</b> If you have a relevant personal experience with bias or
                discrimination (as a target or an ally), sharing it can make the lesson more relatable and impactful.
            </li>
            <li><b>Focus on Action:</b> While understanding is crucial, the emphasis should shift towards what they
                <u>can do</u>.</li>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            <li><b>Follow Up:</b> In the coming weeks, casually bring up related news stories or observations to
                reinforce the lessons learned. Acknowledge and praise instances where they demonstrate allyship.</li>
        </div>
